The extraction is accomplished by application of an electrical field between a temporary external anode and steel embedded in concrete. The electric field induces an ionic current in the concrete electrolyte, a portion of which is carried by the negatively charged chloride ions moving away from the embedded steel and towards the external anode. Once sufficient amount of chloride ions are extracted the surface of the concrete element is sealed to prevent future ingress of chloride ions into the concrete. To ascertain the long-term effectiveness of ECE, a total of 10 laboratory specimens fabricated and treated in an earlier study were evaluated over a five year period. At the start of this study, these specimens had already undergone five years of post treatment evaluation. Since treatment, the specimens were continually exposed to Northern Virginia climate. The variables in the specimen matrix included current density, total charge passed, anode material, and electrolyte. Three different current densities ranging from 93 to 600 mA/m2, three different total-charge-passed ranging from 645 to 3,226 A-hr/m2, two different types of anode material, and three different electrolytes had been used to obtain a total of 10 specimens. A bridge deck of one structure and columns of another, treated during the earlier study were also included in this evaluation. The results of the long-term evaluation suggest that ECE was effective in mitigating corrosion in the laboratory specimens for over 10 years. Corrosion continued unabated in the control specimen and exhibited corrosion induced damage. Whereas, only specimens receiving a total charge of 645 A-hr/m2 exhibited early signs of corrosion initiation after 10 years of exposure. Although, some remigration of chloride ions was observed in the concrete above the top mat of reinforcing steel, no such migration was noted at the depth of the top mat reinforcing steel. Although chloride ions had been successfully extracted from the bridge deck, no difference between the treated and the control area were observed due to insufficient passage of time after treatment. The ECE treatment on the columns of the bridge deck had encountered several problems and was not successful in mitigating corrosion.</jats:p>", "authors": "[\"Ali Akbar Sohanghpurwala\"]", "venue": "CORROSION 2003", "year": 2003, "date": null, "relevance_score": null, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": null, "file_size": null, "source": "crossref", "oa_status": "fulltext_pdf", "topic": null}

However, experimental issues such as inadequate bar end isolation, ponding bath leakage, and inappropriate specimen design and testing methodology can result in data that misrepresents long-term service performance. Further, the fact that most testing protocols employ cyclic chloride solution ponding can lead to erroneous ranking of different corrosion resistant reinforcements and false projection of service performance, specifically because surface chloride concentration becomes elevated compared to that for actual service. The present paper discusses these issues and provides options whereby accelerated test data can be acquired that more correctly rank different reinforcements and thereby more realistically represent service performance.</jats:p>", "authors": "[\"William H.

Concrete with good durability will withstand adverse conditions like frost, chloride penetration, sulfate assault, alkali-aggregate reaction, steel corrosion, etc., which will lower the strength of the concrete. Strength is vital, but so is durability. The present study examined and discussed the durability parameters of conventional concrete made with geopolymer aggregate (GPA) as a partial substitute for natural aggregate. Strength studies in this research found that the optimal level of substitution for natural coarse aggregate by GPA was 100% replacement to produce the performing concrete. Replacement of natural coarse aggregate by geopolymer aggregate exhibits 9%–15% higher compressive strength than natural aggregate concrete. The findings reveal that concrete with 100% geopolymer aggregate exhibits a compressive strength increase of 9%–15% over that of concrete made with natural aggregates. Ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements for geopolymer aggregate concrete range between 4 km/s and 4.5 km/s, indicating good quality according to IS specifications. Additionally, Rebound Hammer test results further support the enhanced quality of geopolymer aggregate concrete. However, the porosity of geopolymer aggregates results in a sorptivity that is 10%–30% higher than that of natural aggregate concrete. Despite this, the increased resistance to acid and sulfate attacks is noted, attributed to the strong bonding between geopolymer aggregates and the cement matrix.", "authors": "[\"T.

This damage mechanism mainly applies to directly weathered components. After a longer service life, however, components that are not directly exposed, such as concrete surfaces outside the spraying water area of a tunnel, are also affected. A long-term study over 12 years was performed to investigate the effect of hydrophobic treatment on the moisture balance and durability of a suspended tunnel ceiling compared to an untreated surface with the same exposure. Embedded sensors installed in the concrete structure and an online monitoring system were used to measure the electrical resistivity of the concrete and the corrosion rate of the steel reinforcement over time. Furthermore, the data obtained were combined with climate measurements in the tunnel to gain new insights on the effect of tunnel climate on the damage mechanism.

The reasons for this are reviewed briefly, together with recent experimental work that better defines the role of chlorides. One is initiation of reinforcement corrosion but only through localized pitting at air-voids in concrete at the interface with the steel reinforcement. These tend to be small or negligible for high quality well-compacted concretes. The other role for chlorides has been shown, in experimental work, to accelerate the long-term loss of concrete alkali material. On the other hand, a review of practical experience shows that what has been termed chloride-induced reinforcement corrosion often is not that at all, but is the end-product of factors that impair the protective nature of the concrete. As reviewed herein, these include poor compaction, physical damage to concrete cover, concrete shrinkage, and alkali-aggregate reactions.

One of the main causes of concrete structures’ deterioration is chloride-induced corrosion of the reinforcement. The reinforcement corrosion process in concrete is composed of two main stages: the initiation phase, which is the amount of time required for chloride ions to reach the reinforcement, and the propagation phase, which is the active phase of corrosion. The inherent complexities associated with the properties of precursors and type of activators, and with the multi-physics processes, in which different transfer mechanisms (moisture, chloride, oxygen, and charge transfer) are involved and interact with each other, have been a major obstacle to predicting the durability of reinforced alkali-activated concretes in chloride environments. Alternatively, the durability of alkali-activated concretes can be assessed through testing. However, the performance-based tests that are currently available, such as the rapid chloride permeability test, the migration test or the bulk diffusion test, are only focusing on the initiation phase of the corrosion process. As a result, existing testing protocols do not capture every aspect of the material performance, which could potentially lead to misleading conclusions, particularly when involving an electrical potential to reduce the testing time. In this paper, a new performance-based test is proposed for assessing the performance of alkali-activated concretes in chloride environments, accounting for both the initiation and propagation phases of the corrosion process.

Nevertheless, regular monitoring of steel corrosion activity in test beams should be conducted, and necessary durability maintenance measures should be taken.", "authors": "[\"Mingzhi Lu\", \"Yixing Ding\", \"Qingqiang Lu\", \"Bo Gao\", \"Leigang Wang\", \"Kexin Hao\", \"Yanmin Jia\"]", "venue": "International Journal of Structural Integrity", "year": 2025, "date": null, "relevance_score": null, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": null, "file_size": null, "source": "semantic_scholar", "oa_status": "open", "topic": null}

This review synthesizes the findings on the deterioration mechanisms in concrete structures, focusing on carbonation, chloride-induced corrosion, and time-dependent deterioration. The analysis includes discussions on predictive likelihood methods for estimating bridge reliability, the impact of environmental factors on carbonation, and standardized testing methods for assessing concrete durability. The review highlights the importance of understanding material characteristics and environmental conditions in designing durable concrete structures, emphasizing the processes of carbonation, its impact on rebar corrosion, and strategies for mitigation. Sheltered concrete carbonation resistance in metropolitan tropical climates is 10-20% lower than open exposure. SCM concretes exhibit equivalent or greater long-term carbonation resistance to OPC concretes, as evidenced by the increase in carbonation depth ( Δ xd) at ages greater than 5 years. The paper concludes with recommendations for integrating advanced modeling techniques and empirical studies to develop robust maintenance strategies and improve concrete mix designs for enhanced durability.", "authors": "[\"K.

A thorough investigation was essential to explore theoretical and experimental aspects of slope durability degradation and its implications on long-term stability. Hence, a durability model was developed to accommodate slope stabilization using reinforced concrete (RC) support structures. This model was grounded in classical durability principles for RC structures. Subsequently, a model test was conducted to compare the responses of a standard slope model with a weakened counterpart subjected to environmental impacts. According to the proposed methodology for slope durability and stability, a case study involving future durability and stability predictions was performed. It was found that the theoretical solutions for the carbonation or neutralization (CN) velocity, depth, and penetration time agreed well with model test results. The slope surface displacements of the weakened slope with deteriorating coefficients between 0.6 and 0.9 were 4 to 8 times those of the standard slope, demonstrating significant degradation in stability. The case study indicated a steady reduction in the safety factor, at a rate of 2.3 to 2.4‰ per year throughout the slope’s service life. Finite-element-based predictions also suggested the potential for corrosion of slope anchor bolts within 20 years and breakage within 30 years, at an average rate of 7.5‰ per year in the ultimate bearing capacity. These findings highlight the need for timely maintenance and reinforcement interventions to ensure the long-term durability of operational slopes.", "authors": "[\"Wenya Ye\", \"Yongzheng Ma\", \"Cuigui Qin\", \"Huajun Wang\", \"Chunguang Li\", \"Zhouxiang Ding\"]", "venue": "Scientific Reports", "year": 2024, "date": null, "relevance_score": null, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": null, "file_size": null, "source": "semantic_scholar", "oa_status": "open", "topic": null}

Political, administrative, and budgetary factors, coupled with climate change, pose tasks to structural integrity, affecting industries and economies. Marine infrastructures represent a strategic asset of a country as they handle a large part of the economic exchanges. This article analyzes five essential factors that play a fundamental role in the performance analysis of coastal structures: chloride-induced corrosion, degradation models, maintenance strategies, monitoring, and climate change. We start with reinforcement corrosion, which is considered as the main cause of distress, particularly in coastal zones, for the long-term behavior of structures. Additional pressure from the influences of climate change is becoming evident and extreme, leading to a reduction in capacity. To guarantee the lifespan of infrastructures, degradation models contribute by estimating the long-term performance of the asset as a strategic piece to the development of effective maintenance solutions. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have gained recent prominence in this field due to their ability to learn intricate patterns from historical data, making them valuable instruments for predicting structural deterioration. Additionally, quantifying the condition of the structure from monitoring data plays a crucial part in providing information on the current situation of the structure. Finally, this review summarizes the challenges associated with the maintenance of aging marine structures considering aspects such as corrosion, monitoring, and the future challenges this area will face due to climate change.", "authors": "[\"Luis F.

This paper discusses three types of laboratory testing methods for studying the corrosion of SFRC induced by chlorides: the ion diffusion method, electric field migration method, and pre-corrosion method. The similar relationship between short-term accelerated deterioration tests and the natural corrosion process, as well as the experimental setup for simulating the coupling effect of multiple factors, requires further exploration. Furthermore, the mechanisms of steel fibers influencing the chloride corrosion resistance of SFRC are explored from four aspects: type, coating, shape, and dosage. Finally, by examining practical case studies of SFRC in subsea tunnel applications, the challenges posed by the multi-directionality of chloride ion corrosion, the diversity of corrosion sources, and the uneven distribution of steel fibers are highlighted. Future research should focus on enhancing the application of SFRC in subsea tunnel linings. This study provides a reference and basis for promoting the application of SFRC in subsea tunnel engineering and indicates future development directions.", "authors": "[\"Jiguo Liu\", \"Longhai Wei\", \"Qinglong Cui\", \"Heng Shu\", \"Wenbo Peng\", \"Huimin Gong\", \"Yiguo Xue\", \"Min Han\"]", "venue": "Coatings", "year": 2025, "date": null, "relevance_score": null, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": null, "file_size": null, "source": "semantic_scholar", "oa_status": "open", "topic": null}

An essential part of estimating the service life of the reinforced concrete (RC) structures is estimating the time when the corrosion begins. The diffusion coefficient that leads to the concentration of chloride ions in concrete is one of the most important parameters for evaluating the corrosion initiation time. This study determined the chloride diffusion coefficient by preparing samples containing different admixtures based on the Nord-test accelerated migration test. The samples are placed in two environmental conditions, submerged and dry and wet cycles for 180 days. The Charged System Search (CSS) meta-exploration algorithm based on the Hesofer-Lind-Rakowitz-Fissler (HL-RF) method evaluated corrosion and chloride diffusion coefficient initiation time. Test results and numerical models showed that in a sample with admixture, its corrosion resistance was almost two times that of the ordinary concrete and the initial corrosion time. If several types of admixture are used, the corrosion time becomes twice as long as when only one admixture is utilized. The best performance for the durability of concrete belonged to the samples with three admixtures. Using additives, MK, SF, and SL, with concrete results in the probability of corrosion to decrease by about 40% after 25 years, and at 50 years, this value becomes about 50%.", "authors": "[\"Shahram TaleshAbedini\", \"Hossein Rahami\", \"Seyed Mohammad Mir Hosseini\", \"E.
