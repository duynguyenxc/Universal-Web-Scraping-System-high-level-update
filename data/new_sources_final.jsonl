The extraction is accomplished by application of an electrical field between a temporary external anode and steel embedded in concrete. The electric field induces an ionic current in the concrete electrolyte, a portion of which is carried by the negatively charged chloride ions moving away from the embedded steel and towards the external anode. Once sufficient amount of chloride ions are extracted the surface of the concrete element is sealed to prevent future ingress of chloride ions into the concrete. To ascertain the long-term effectiveness of ECE, a total of 10 laboratory specimens fabricated and treated in an earlier study were evaluated over a five year period. At the start of this study, these specimens had already undergone five years of post treatment evaluation. Since treatment, the specimens were continually exposed to Northern Virginia climate. The variables in the specimen matrix included current density, total charge passed, anode material, and electrolyte. Three different current densities ranging from 93 to 600 mA/m2, three different total-charge-passed ranging from 645 to 3,226 A-hr/m2, two different types of anode material, and three different electrolytes had been used to obtain a total of 10 specimens. A bridge deck of one structure and columns of another, treated during the earlier study were also included in this evaluation. The results of the long-term evaluation suggest that ECE was effective in mitigating corrosion in the laboratory specimens for over 10 years. Corrosion continued unabated in the control specimen and exhibited corrosion induced damage. Whereas, only specimens receiving a total charge of 645 A-hr/m2 exhibited early signs of corrosion initiation after 10 years of exposure. Although, some remigration of chloride ions was observed in the concrete above the top mat of reinforcing steel, no such migration was noted at the depth of the top mat reinforcing steel. Although chloride ions had been successfully extracted from the bridge deck, no difference between the treated and the control area were observed due to insufficient passage of time after treatment. The ECE treatment on the columns of the bridge deck had encountered several problems and was not successful in mitigating corrosion.</jats:p>", "authors": "[\"Ali Akbar Sohanghpurwala\"]", "venue": "CORROSION 2003", "year": 2003, "date": null, "relevance_score": 1.0, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": null, "file_size": null, "source": "crossref", "oa_status": "fulltext_pdf", "topic": null, "full_content": null}

The slabs were first submitted to plain or salted water imbibition for five years and then exposed outdoors in an urban area. Over the last ten years, a series of non-destructive tests was comparatively carried out in two phases, to try to improve the accuracy of corrosion prediction in reinforced concrete. During the first 5-years phase, the progression of the imbibition was followed up by resistivity, potential and linear polarization measurements.

Two concrete mixes (T1 and T2), incorporating distinct supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), were evaluated to determine their performance in aggressive environments. Specimens with varying reservoir lengths were exposed to a 10% NaCl solution (by weight), with electromigration applied to accelerate chloride transport. Electrochemical assessments, including measurements of rebar potential, concrete solution resistance, concrete polarization resistance, corrosion current, and mass loss, were conducted to monitor the degradation of embedded steel. The findings revealed that smaller reservoirs (2.5 cm) significantly restricted chloride and moisture penetration, reducing corrosion, while larger reservoirs (10 cm) resulted in greater exposure and higher corrosion activity. Additionally, T1 mixes (partial cement replacement with 20% fly ash and 50% slag) showed higher corrosion currents and mass loss, whereas T2 mixes (partial cement replacement with 20% fly ash and 8% silica fume) demonstrated enhanced matrix densification, reduced permeability, and superior durability.

Concrete with good durability will withstand adverse conditions like frost, chloride penetration, sulfate assault, alkali-aggregate reaction, steel corrosion, etc., which will lower the strength of the concrete. Strength is vital, but so is durability. The present study examined and discussed the durability parameters of conventional concrete made with geopolymer aggregate (GPA) as a partial substitute for natural aggregate. Strength studies in this research found that the optimal level of substitution for natural coarse aggregate by GPA was 100% replacement to produce the performing concrete. Replacement of natural coarse aggregate by geopolymer aggregate exhibits 9%–15% higher compressive strength than natural aggregate concrete. The findings reveal that concrete with 100% geopolymer aggregate exhibits a compressive strength increase of 9%–15% over that of concrete made with natural aggregates. Ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements for geopolymer aggregate concrete range between 4 km/s and 4.5 km/s, indicating good quality according to IS specifications. Additionally, Rebound Hammer test results further support the enhanced quality of geopolymer aggregate concrete. However, the porosity of geopolymer aggregates results in a sorptivity that is 10%–30% higher than that of natural aggregate concrete.

The corrosion propagation was monitored over 1600 days using electrochemical techniques such as Linear Polarization Resistance (LPR), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), and Galvanostatic Pulse (GP) measurements. The study evaluated how the composition of the concrete mixes and reservoir length influenced corrosion, by testing both binary mixes (SL and FA) and ternary mixes (T1 and T2). The results show that the LPR readings, which uses prolonged polarization, generally produces higher corrosion current values than GP readings, offering a dynamic view of corrosion but greater variability. The binary mixes with slag (SL) or fly ash (FA) exhibit higher corrosion currents, while ternary mixes, especially those containing fly ash and silica fume (T2), show reduced corrosion currents, suggesting improved resistance. The larger reservoir length contributed to higher corrosion currents, highlighting the critical influence of exposure conditions, concrete mix composition, and measurement techniques in evaluating corrosion.

The reasons for this are reviewed briefly, together with recent experimental work that better defines the role of chlorides. One is initiation of reinforcement corrosion but only through localized pitting at air-voids in concrete at the interface with the steel reinforcement. These tend to be small or negligible for high quality well-compacted concretes. The other role for chlorides has been shown, in experimental work, to accelerate the long-term loss of concrete alkali material. On the other hand, a review of practical experience shows that what has been termed chloride-induced reinforcement corrosion often is not that at all, but is the end-product of factors that impair the protective nature of the concrete. As reviewed herein, these include poor compaction, physical damage to concrete cover, concrete shrinkage, and alkali-aggregate reactions.

One of the main causes of concrete structures’ deterioration is chloride-induced corrosion of the reinforcement. The reinforcement corrosion process in concrete is composed of two main stages: the initiation phase, which is the amount of time required for chloride ions to reach the reinforcement, and the propagation phase, which is the active phase of corrosion. The inherent complexities associated with the properties of precursors and type of activators, and with the multi-physics processes, in which different transfer mechanisms (moisture, chloride, oxygen, and charge transfer) are involved and interact with each other, have been a major obstacle to predicting the durability of reinforced alkali-activated concretes in chloride environments. Alternatively, the durability of alkali-activated concretes can be assessed through testing. However, the performance-based tests that are currently available, such as the rapid chloride permeability test, the migration test or the bulk diffusion test, are only focusing on the initiation phase of the corrosion process. As a result, existing testing protocols do not capture every aspect of the material performance, which could potentially lead to misleading conclusions, particularly when involving an electrical potential to reduce the testing time. In this paper, a new performance-based test is proposed for assessing the performance of alkali-activated concretes in chloride environments, accounting for both the initiation and propagation phases of the corrosion process.

Monitoring of the corrosion condition of the repair and control areas was performed for up to 4 to 6 years after the inhibitors had been used in the repair. Visual, delamination, cover, and half-cell potential surveys, corrosion rate measurements, and chloride ion content analyses were regularly performed to monitor the condition of the repair areas, the interface between the repair area and the original concrete, and the original concrete. In three of the four bridge structures, the corrosion condition of the repair areas treated with corrosion inhibitors was not noticeably different from the repairs performed without any corrosion inhibitors.

Two concrete mixes (T1 and T2), incorporating distinct supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), were evaluated to determine their performance in aggressive environments. Specimens with varying reservoir lengths were exposed to a 10% NaCl solution, with electromigration applied to accelerate chloride transport. Electrochemical assessments, including measurements of rebar potential, concrete solution resistance, corrosion current, and mass loss, were conducted to monitor the degradation of embedded steel. The findings revealed that smaller reservoirs (2.5 cm) significantly restricted chloride and moisture penetration, reducing corrosion, while larger reservoirs (10 cm) resulted in greater exposure and higher corrosion activity. Additionally, T1 mixes (cement replacement of 20% fly ash and 50% slag) showed higher corrosion currents and mass loss, whereas T2 mixes (cement replacement of 20% fly ash and 8% silica fume) demonstrated enhanced matrix densification, reduced permeability, and superior durability. These results underscore the importance of mix design and exposure conditions in mitigating corrosion, providing critical insights for improving the longevity of RC structures in aggressive environments.", "authors": "[\"Kazi Naimul Hoque\", \"Francisco Presuel-Moreno\"]", "venue": null, "year": 2025, "date": null, "relevance_score": 1.0, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": "cc-by", "file_size": null, "source": "crossref", "oa_status": "repository", "topic": null, "full_content": null}

The approach considers that all relevant variables (surface Cl− concentration, effective Cl− diffusion coefficient (D), concrete cover, and critical Cl− concentration threshold to initiate corrosion) conform to a distribution rather than being discrete, as is now known to be the case. Upon inputting distribution parameters for the above variables into the equation, the fraction of elements that have initiated corrosion after a designated time is determined. Upon repeating the calculation for different times, a cumulative distribution function plot for occurrence of corrosion initiation results. Previously, the mean and standard deviation of the above variables were assumed to be constant with time. It is generally recognized, however, that D decreases with time according to a power law expression in response to progressive cement hydration. In the present study, the extent of corrosion initiation was investigated considering this time dependence for D. Implications of the results with regard to the evolution of corrosion initiation are discussed.", "authors": "[\"William H.

The approach accommodates the fact that surface Cl− concentration (Cs), the effective diffusion coefficient (D), and reinforcement cover (x) each conform to a distribution, rather than being discreet. Calculations were performed for a range of mean D, Cs, and x values. The previously reported limiting [Cl−] for which various dosages of the corrosion inhibitor calcium nitrite (CN) are effective in maintaining reinforcing steel passivity was superimposed upon the CDFs. From probability distributions of, first, [Cl−] and, second, Cl− threshold to initiate active corrosion, as enhanced by a particular CN addition, the percentage of reinforced concrete elements for which active corrosion initiates after specific times and, hence, inhibitor effectiveness, were determined using a Load-Resistance Factor Design type approach. Inhibitor effectiveness in reducing total corrosion is discussed, as are scenarios and implications thereof for chlorides and CN being solely in the cement phase as opposed to being uniformly distributed throughout the concrete.", "authors": "[\"William H.

In the United States, with its vast infrastructure of concrete and steel bridges, superhighways, and reinforced concrete buildings, billions of dollars have been spent on corrosion protection. Among the commercial technologies available today, migrating corrosion inhibitors (MCIs) show versatility in their use as admixtures, surface treatments, and in rehabilitation programs. The effectiveness of two commercial inhibitors applied to the reinforced concrete surface was evaluated. The corrosion behavior of the steel rebar was monitored using AC electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Corrosion potentials and polarization resistance values corroborated the inhibiting effects of the amine carboxylate and amino alcohol chemistry in an aggressive environment. The MCI products have successfully inhibited corrosion of the rebar in a 3.5% NaCl solution for duration of testing. MCI protected samples showed an average corrosion rate of 0.34 μA/cm2 compared to untreated samples that were 1.50 μA/cm2. This will increase the life expectancy by more than 15 years. XPS analysis demonstrated the presence of inhibitor on the steel rebar surface indicating MCI migration through the concrete.", "authors": "[\"Behzad Bavarian\", \"Lisa Reiner\"]", "venue": "CORROSION 2004", "year": 2004, "date": null, "relevance_score": 1.0, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": null, "file_size": null, "source": "crossref", "oa_status": "fulltext_pdf", "topic": null, "full_content": null}

Investigation of the durability of concrete generally consists of either the causes of deterioration or the extent of it. Usually, methods used to improve the durability of concrete aim to prevent the causes of deterioration; however, occasionally methods that limit the extent of damage are employed. In this context, and in order to propose test, which can assess the durability between the material properties and deterioration mechanisms, is carried out. Such an analysis should help to focus the attention of various investigators the key issues that ultimately determine the durability of concrete structures. Concerning the various deterioration mechanisms described above, one of the fundamental properties that influences the initiation and extent of damage of concrete is corrosion of reinforcement in the concrete structure. Environmental effects such as the freezing and thawing cycles have caused deterioration of the bridge decks and all other exposed reinforced concrete structures. Concrete is full of microcracks even when it is not loaded. When under vehicular traffic, some structural cracks form that can join the other already existing cracks, providing an easy route to reinforcing steel for the deicing salt. The presence of shrinkage and temperature cracks can also do the same. When chloride ions along with moisture reach the level of reinforcing steel, they start corroding the steel reinforcement. Corrosion of steel reinforcement in concrete bridge decks and parking structures is one of the most common types of deterioration, which has substantially reduced the useful life of such facilities.

Investigation of the durability of concrete generally consists of either the causes of deterioration or the extent of it. Usually, methods used to improve the durability of concrete aim to prevent the causes of deterioration; however, occasionally methods that limit the extent of damage are employed. In this context, and in order to propose test, which can assess the durability between the material properties and deterioration mechanisms, is carried out. Such an analysis should help to focus the attention of various investigators the key issues that ultimately determine the durability of concrete structures. Concerning the various deterioration mechanisms described above, one of the fundamental properties that influences the initiation and extent of damage of concrete is corrosion of reinforcement in the concrete structure. Environmental effects such as the freezing and thawing cycles have caused deterioration of the bridge decks and all other exposed reinforced concrete structures. Concrete is full of microcracks even when it is not loaded. When under vehicular traffic, some structural cracks form that can join the other already existing cracks, providing an easy route to reinforcing steel for the deicing salt. The presence of shrinkage and temperature cracks can also do the same. When chloride ions along with moisture reach the level of reinforcing steel, they start corroding the steel reinforcement. Corrosion of steel reinforcement in concrete bridge decks and parking structures is one of the most common types of deterioration, which has substantially reduced the useful life of such facilities. This widespread problem and the rapidly increasing cost of maintenance and repair have resulted in great economic and social repercussions.

A new model of chloride diffusion coefficient, which varies with the ingress depth of chloride ion and w/c, is developed. A spatial time-dependent reliability model of time to corrosion initiation (TCI) for reinforced concrete (RC) structures is developed, considering spatial variability of geometric, material and environmental parameters. The test results show that the chloride diffusion coefficient increases as w/c increases, and chloride diffusion velocity decreases as penetration depth increases. It is found that the probability of corrosion initiation considering spatial variability is 13.1–18.5% greater than that without consideration of spatial variability. This indicates that neglecting spatial variations in evaluating probability of corrosion initiation time overestimates the structural reliability. It is also found that the probability of corrosion initiation for future climate change is 9–11% higher than that obtained from constant temperature. The mean value of TCI based on a time-dependent chloride diffusion coefficient is 16.7% less than that obtained for a constant chloride diffusion coefficient. This suggests that it is more appropriate if penetration depth and w/c is considered when determining the time-dependent chloride diffusion coefficient.", "authors": "[\"Jianxin Peng\", \"Huang Tang\", \"Linfa Xiao\", \"Xiaokang Cheng\", \"Jianren Zhang\"]", "venue": "Magazine of Concrete Research", "year": 2021, "date": null, "relevance_score": 1.0, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": null, "file_size": null, "source": "crossref", "oa_status": "open", "topic": null, "full_content": null}

One of the most important reserves for saving material and energy resources in the construction industry is the re-involvement of recycled (concrete) crushed stone in the production sector, in particular for the production of heavy concrete of classes B7,5–B35 for general construction purposes. Solving this problem will practically ensure the implementation of the most important principle of waste-free technological processes (in the production of precast and monolithic concrete and reinforced concrete structures) and create conditions for fulfilling important social, economic and environmental tasks. Aim. Conducting experimental studies to determine the standardized durability characteristics of concrete and reinforced concrete based on recycled (concrete) crushed stone and natural sand, as well as comparing them with similar concretes based on natural crushed stone and sand. Materials and methods. For the research, recycled (concrete) and granite (natural) crushed stone according to State Standard 8267-93 were used as coarse aggregates. Natural sand according to State Standard 8736-2014 was used as a fine aggregate. Portland cement according to State Standard 31108-2020 was used as a binder. Superplasticizer C-3 according to State Standard 24211-2008 was used as an additive. The mixing water was used according to State Standard 23732-2011. Results. Concretes based on recycled crushed stone and natural sand have slightly lower strength, density and identical indicators of water resistance and frost resistance compared to similar concrete based on natural crushed stone and natural sand. Conclusions. Based on the results of the work carried out, it was revealed that concrete based on recycled crushed stone and natural sand ensures the initial passive state of steel reinforcement and retains the passive state of steel reinforcement for a long time (more than 100 years) with a protective layer thickness of 10 mm. Concretes based on recycled crushed stone and natural sand can be used as traditional structural concretes for general construction purposes.", "authors": "[\"Zamir U. Beppaev\", \"Lydia H.

However, corrosion of steel reinforcement in reinforced concrete (RC) structures can be classified into two categories: general (uniform) corrosion and pitting (localised) corrosion. In general, concrete researchers use uniform corrosion to study the effect of corrosion on RC structures. This approach is not accurate for concrete structures subjected to chloride attack, which usually experiences pitting corrosion. This paper describes an accelerated corrosion test used to obtain statistical parameters of maximum pit-depths distribution of corroded steel in a RC structure. Using probabilistic analysis, these statistical parameters are combined with statistical parameters of RC beams (i.e. beam dimensions, concrete strength, steel yield strength, cover thickness, workmanship quality, in situ strength factor, model error for flexure and shear and also corrosion rate) to determine the effect of corrosion on flexural and shear strength of RC beams. Using the proposed pitting corrosion model improves service life prediction of RC structures in a chloride environment.", "authors": "[\"M.S.

The approach considers that all relevant variables (surface Cl− concentration, effective Cl− diffusion coefficient [D], concrete cover, and critical Cl− concentration threshold to initiate corrosion) conform to a distribution rather than being discrete, as is now known to be the case. Upon inputting distribution parameters for the above variables into the equation, the fraction of elements that have initiated corrosion after a designated time is determined. Upon repeating the calculation for different times, a cumulative distribution function plot for occurrence of corrosion initiation results. Previously, the mean and standard deviation of the above variables were assumed to be constant with time. It is generally recognized, however, that D decreases with time according to a power law expression in response to progressive cement hydration.

In addition, the presence of fibers can improve the steel‐to‐concrete bond behavior reducing the steel‐to‐concrete interface damage after cracking. Cracks and steel‐to‐concrete interface damage work like paths, for aggressive agents, to reach the rebar in cracking elements, reducing the initiation period of the corrosion process, and favoring the corrosion at the intersection between cracks and reinforcement. In this context, this article discusses an experimental program on tension ties mechanically cracked and exposed to a chloride‐rich environment with the purpose to check and eventually adequate the typical electrochemical measurements, used in the case of RC elements, for Steel Fiber Reinforced Concrete (SFRC). Adjustments related to degradation morphology and interference of steel fibers are proposed and used on Fiber Reinforced Concrete (FRC) elements for monitoring the influence of cracks and fibers on corrosion propagation. Finally, these proposed modifications were checked and validated against the results obtained by monitoring SFRC beams in the cracked stage.", "authors": "[\"Enzo Gomez\", \"Bruno Leporace\\u2010Guimil\", \"Antonio Conforti\", \"Giovanni Plizzari\", \"Gustavo Duff\\u00f3\", \"Raul Zerbino\"]", "venue": "Structural Concrete", "year": 2023, "date": null, "relevance_score": 1.0, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": "cc-by", "file_size": null, "source": "crossref", "oa_status": "publisher", "topic": null, "full_content": null}

In response to this, an equation has been derived whereby the fraction of electrochemically independent reinforced concrete elements within which corrosion caused damage has resulted after a given exposure time is calculated. The approach considers that all relevant variables conform to some distribution rather than being discrete, as is now known to be the case. These variables are 1) surface Cl− concentration, 2) the effective Cl− diffusion coefficient, 3) concrete cover, and 4) the critical Cl− concentration threshold to initiate corrosion. Upon inputting 1) distribution parameters for the above variables, 2) the critical reinforcement corrosion loss to cause concrete damage, and 3) the average corrosion rate over the exposure period and numerically integrating, the fraction of elements that has experienced cracking/delamination after the selected time was determined. Upon repeating the calculation for incremental times, a cumulative distribution function plot for occurrence of 1) corrosion initiation and 2) cracking/delamination was constructed. Example results are provided for concrete reinforced with both black bar and select corrosion resistant reinforcements.

In the course of the study, a calculated justification of the strength of a reinforced concrete beam reinforced with composite materials was performed. At the first stage, an elastic finite element model was developed to analyze the stress distribution and calculate the required reinforcement area. At the second stage, a nonlinear deformation model of concrete is included, the cracking process is taken into account. Iterative calculations have shown the achievement of the limiting state of the structure. At the third stage, a model with external composite reinforcement was created. The reinforcement reduced the deflection from 7.36 to 6.47 mm, reduced the stresses in the reinforcement by 17.46 % and increased the bearing capacity by 32 %. Experimental studies are planned, including consideration of dynamic effects and temperature and humidity factors. Aim. The main aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of fiber-reinforced polymer-based composite materials for reinforced concrete structures strengthening. The stress-strain states of reinforced and unreinforced structures were also compared. Materials and methods. Computational studies of reinforced concrete structures were performed using the finite element method with nonlinear models in the ANSYS software package. Results. The analysis of the stress-strain state of the reinforced concrete structure with and without external composite reinforcement was carried out, allowing for an assessment of the effectiveness of composite reinforcement for improving the strength and durability of the structure. The study models and analyzes the stress-strain state of such structures when using external reinforcement and evaluates the impact of composite materials on stress and deflection reducing, and load-bearing capacity of the structure increasing. Conclusions. The study results indicate that using of composite materials for external reinforcement of reinforced concrete structures effectively reduces reinforcement stresses, decreases deflection, and prevents crack formation under composite covering. Maximum tensile stresses in the reinforcement were reduced by 17.46 %, and the load-bearing capacity of the structure increased by 32 % (from 126.75 to 167.31 kN).", "authors": "[\"Igor V.

Corrosion of steel reinforcement by chloride attack is considered. At the material level, the effects of corrosion are considered by modeling the degradation of the mechanical properties of steel reinforcement, softening of cover concrete under compression, degradation of core concrete due to confinement steel corrosion, and reduction of bond strength between concrete and steel reinforcement. At the structural level, the effects of corrosion on both flexural behavior and shear behavior, and their interaction are considered. Eleven bridges of various structural types in Taiwan that are located within 6.5 km of their nearest coastline are analyzed to identify their long‐term seismic performance. Relationships between the yield and collapse peak ground accelerations (PGAs), and service time and corrosion level are established for each bridge. Analysis results show that chloride corrosion starts in 2–32 years. The transverse steel reinforcement typically starts corroding before the longitudinal steel reinforcement, as the former has a thicker cover. Research results show that collapse PGA reduces by 0.94% or 1.23% per 10 years when the mean value plus 1 or 2 standard deviation of the collapse PGA values are considered, respectively. Therefore, we suggest increasing the design PGA from 4.70% to 6.15% for a bridge adjacent to a coastline to ensure adequate long‐term seismic performance for 50 years, the typical design life span of a regular bridge.

This implicates different disadvantages concerning the electrical connection and the manageability of the measuring device during the measurement. In order to assess single measuring points without comprising the potential map over the whole surface and to improve the handling during the measurement a method was developed to locate areas with a high risk of reinforcement corrosion without a wired connection to the reinforcement.

The corrosion mechanisms vary greatly due to the multitude of engineered highway systems with the varying exposure environments, chemistry, and construction materials. Of the many engineering systems in the highway infrastructure, corrosion of reinforcing steel in bridge substructures has been critical. It is therefore highly advantageous to evaluate the performances of implemented corrosion control measures. Five bridges in Florida utilizing various corrosion mitigation strategies were revisited in 2021 to provide a prospective of their corrosion durability after several decades of service. The assessment compared plain to epoxy coated rebar, use of fly ash, and the use of concrete coatings. The presence of flyash in concrete mix designs allow for slower chloride diffusion rates. The presence of concrete surface coatings can allow lower chloride surface concentrations to develop. Bridge service life assessment should not account for chloride ion diffusivity alone as it was shown that elevated initial chloride concentrations can facilitate corrosion conditions. The barrier provided by epoxy-coated rebar can extend the time to initial concrete degradation caused by corrosion, but corrosion can still develop on the coated reinforcing steel.", "authors": "[\"Kingsley Lau\", \"Samanbar Permeh\", \"John S.

The rust phases of the steel were detected by X-ray diffraction and Raman analysis. It was found that the convection depth for chloride transport in cracked concrete was significantly larger than that in uncracked concrete. The concrete in a pier column facing upstream had greater porosity due to the water impact and calcium leaching. The coefficients of variability of chloride diffusivity of concrete for the bridge deck and the pier column were significantly different. Rust phases including lepidocrocite, goethite, akaganeite, magnetite, and maghemite were detected using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The major phases of steel rust in the atmospheric zone were lepidocrocite and goethite, while they were lepidocrocite and maghemite in the tidal zone.

The properties of concrete can be improved by adding materials like basalt fiber (BF). To investigate the degradation process and mechanism of cast-in situ concrete with premixed BF under the dual corrosion of sulfate and magnesium salts, concrete with a content of BF ranging from 0 to 0.5% was prepared. Specimens were subjected to different internal and external corrosion conditions and immersed for 180 days. Dimension, mass, and appearance changes at different immersion times were recorded. The compressive and flexural strength of the specimens were tested and continually observed throughout the immersion time. Mineral and microstructural changes at different immersion times were determined by the XRD, TG, and SEM analysis methods. Results indicated that external sulfate–internal magnesium combined attack had a significant negative effect on the early strength. The compressive and flexural strength of the corroded specimens decreased by 17.2% and 14.1%, respectively, compared to the control group at 28 days. The premixed magnesium ions caused the decomposition of the C-S-H gel, resulting in severe spalling and lower mechanical properties after immersing for a long time. As the BF can inhibit crack development, the properties of the concrete premixed with BF were improved. Specimens exhibited superior performance at a BF content of 0.5%, resulting in a 16.2% increase in flexural strength.

Low bending stress did not accelerate the degradation of GFPP bars compared with unbent GFPP bars while high bending stress dramatically accelerated the degradation. Microscopic tests found there is corrosion of glass fibers and debonding between glass fibers and polypropylene but no obvious chain breaks of polypropylene occurred. Based on the Arrhenius theory, long‐term stable retention rates of the IFSS of GFPP bars with zero and low bending stress immersed in the simulated SWSC solution are 42.4% and 52.3%.\nLow‐stressed GFPP bars degraded similarly or even slower than unbent GFPP bars.\nGFPP bars degraded mainly due to interfacial debonding and fiber corrosion.\nLong‐term IFSS of GFPP bars under a coupling effect was predicted.", "authors": "[\"Shaoce Dong\", \"Xiao Qi\", \"Jingwei Tian\", \"Ping Zhou\", \"Chenggao Li\", \"Guijun Xian\"]", "venue": "Polymer Composites", "year": 2023, "date": null, "relevance_score": 1.0, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": null, "file_size": null, "source": "semantic_scholar", "oa_status": "open", "topic": null, "full_content": null}

One of the most critical deterioration mechanisms in this process is the corrosion of the reinforcement steel. The initiation and propagation of corrosion adversely affect the load-bearing capacity, bond strength, and overall structural behavior of reinforced concrete elements, thereby threatening the structural safety. Therefore, understanding the corrosion process and accurately predicting the service life of reinforced concrete structures is critical to ensuring their long-term durability. This study comprehensively examines the effects of chloride-induced rebar corrosion on the service life of reinforced concrete structures. Various mathematical models used to predict corrosion initiation and propagation times are analyzed in detail. These models provide a scientific basis for understanding the effects of environmental conditions and structural properties on the corrosion process and estimating how these effects affect the service life. In particular, the study investigates the effect of parameters such as concrete cover thickness, rebar diameter, crack presence, corrosion rate, and environmental conditions on the corrosion process, all of which also affect structural performance. Cracks in reinforced concrete elements shorten the corrosion initiation period depending on their thickness. Considering that the presence of cracks also changes the structural behavior, it is recommended to use the Kwon model, which takes the presence of cracks into account, in the service life calculations. The presence of cracks is ineffective in the corrosion propagation period, and it is recommended to use the Morinaga model for this period. For reinforced concrete elements exposed to aggressive environments, increasing the thickness of the concrete cover and the diameter of the reinforcement has been shown to increase the service life. Columns with larger diameter reinforcement showed a longer service life than beams with smaller diameter reinforcement. Therefore, evaluating each element separately in service life calculations will ensure that a safer approach is taken. In conclusion, this study serves as a valuable resource for developing design strategies to improve the long-term durability of reinforced concrete structures and to minimize the adverse effects of corrosion on structural performance.

Weather and exposure conditions directly affect chloride ingress mechanisms and therefore the operational service life and safety of RC structures. Consequently, comprehensive chloride ingress models are useful tools to estimate corrosion initiation risks and minimize maintenance costs for RC structures placed under chloride-contaminated environments. This paper first presents a coupled thermo-hydro-chemical model for predicting chloride penetration into concrete that accounts for realistic weather conditions. This complete numerical model takes into account multiple factors affecting chloride ingress such as diffusion, convection, chloride binding, ionic interaction, and concrete aging. Since the complete model could be computationally expensive for long-term assessment, this study also proposes model simplifications in order to reduce the computational cost. Long-term chloride assessments of complete and reduced models are compared for three locations in France (Brest, Strasbourg and Nice) characterized by different weather and exposure conditions (tidal zone, de-icing salts and salt spray). The comparative study indicates that the reduced model is computationally efficient and accurate for long-term chloride ingress modeling in comparison to the complete one. Given that long-term assessment requires larger climate databases, this research also studies how climate models may affect chloride ingress assessment.

The combination of these two corrosion processes accelerates the destruction of concrete, leads to extensive structural repairs, negatively impacts durability, and significantly reduces the service life of the structure. One possible and effective way to reduce chloride diffusion through the concrete pore system is through the use of crystalline materials. An experimental study focused on the ability of an applied crystalline coating to increase the chloride resistance of carbonated concrete is presented in this paper. Carbonated concrete specimens treated with a crystalline coating were exposed to a sodium chloride solution for various periods of time, and a water-soluble chloride ion content analysis was performed on powder samples taken from the tested specimens. Chloride profiles presenting the chloride ion concentrations at selected depths are presented for multiple types of concrete at various ages to show the effect of crystalline technology on the chloride resistance of concrete. The results of this study confirm the impact of carbonation on chloride ion ingress through concrete and show that crystalline coatings can improve the chloride resistance of concrete. Using crystalline coatings on carbonated concrete can, from a long-term perspective, significantly reduce the chloride ion content in concrete placed in an aggressive environment. The crystalline coatings were functional even after 28 days, when the concentration of chloride ions was below the critical concentration. The crystalline coating was able to reduce the concentration of chloride ions by 68% under the surface of the concrete and by 65% at depths of 20–25 mm after 180 days of immersion, compared to the untreated concrete.

The experiment utilized M30-grade concrete mixes, substituting 15% of natural coarse aggregates with E-waste, aiming to assess both sustainability and structural performance without compromising durability. EPS configured with Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) patches were embedded into both conventional and E-waste concrete specimens. The EPS monitored the changes in the form of conductance and susceptance signatures across a 100–400 kHz frequency range during accelerated corrosion exposure over a 60-day period in a 3.5% NaCl solution. The corrosion progression was evaluated qualitatively through electrical impedance signatures, visually via rust formation and cracking, and quantitatively using the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of EMI signatures. The results showed that the EMI technique effectively captured the initiation and propagation stages of corrosion. E-waste concrete exhibited earlier and more severe signs of corrosion compared to conventional concrete, indicated by faster increases and subsequent declines in conductance and susceptance and higher RMSD values during the initiation phase. The EMI-based system demonstrated its capability to detect microstructural changes at early stages, making it a promising method for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of sustainable concretes. The study concludes that while the use of E-waste in concrete contributes positively to sustainability, it may compromise long-term durability in aggressive environments.

It also improves the strength development and long-term durability of concrete without reinforcement. Given the fact that reinforcement concrete is most widely used in construction and building fields, the carbon sequestration potential will be enhanced remarkably if this curing technology can be used in reinforced concrete. However, the impacts of early CO2 curing on the corrosion behavior of steels, which is the major concern for reinforced concrete exposure to chloride, is unclear yet. In this work, the permeability of chloride, threshold chloride value and corrosion behaviors of steels in cement mortar were determined to comprehensively study the effect of early CO2 curing on the chloride induced corrosion of steels. Early CO2 curing lowers the chloride ions permeability of mortars, in particular for the mortars with 28 day curing ages. Steels take longer time to form stable passive films in early CO2-cured mortar than in conventional moist-cured ones. Early CO2 curing reduces the chloride threshold concentration of mortar, in particular for the mortars that the whole cross section is carbonated, the reduction reaches ∼50%. However, it exerts few effects on corrosion induction phase of steel rebar. Moreover, early CO2 curing decreases the corrosion rate of steel bars in corrosion propagation phase and thus the overall corrosion rate of steels during the whole testing process due to slower chloride ingress rate. Thus, early CO2 curing can act as an alternative curing technique in the production of pre-cast reinforced concrete exposed to chloride.", "authors": "[\"Baixing Song\", \"Xiang Hu\", \"S.

To improve the safety assessment of existing subsea tunnels, a hydraulic–mechanical–chemical (H–M–C) coupled model is proposed. The long-term distribution of chloride ions migration process with hydrostatic pressure in the RC lining of subsea tunnels can be simulated more accurately. In the H–M–C coupled model, the volume fluid fraction and convection velocity obtained from the bidirectionally coupled hydraulic and mechanic analysis are unidirectionally considered in the analysis of convection, diffusion, and adsorption of chloride ions in the RC lining. In addition, the classic expression of the effective diffusion coefficient is modified by considering a constrictivity factor that varies nonlinearly with the microscopic pore size. Results indicate that the constrictivity factor has a certain effect on the migration of chloride ions in concrete. The service time of the RC subsea tunnel rapidly decreases as the most frequent gel/capillary pores radius increases on a non-linear curve. If the most frequent gel/capillary pores radius of the concrete is small, by appropriately increasing the thickness of the protective layer, the service time of the RC subsea tunnel can be effectively extended. Conversely, once the most frequent gel/capillary pores radius is large, the service time of the RC subsea tunnel will be greatly shortened. At this time, the increase in the thickness of the protective layer will no longer have significant protective effects. Afterward, the sensitivity analyses are carried out on four sets of parameters i.e., saturated permeability, van Genuchten parameters, initial saturation, and binding capacity parameters. The results of the sensitivity analyses suggest that the effects of the most frequent gel/capillary pores radius on the penetration process of chloride ions in the concrete lining of subsea tunnels are more sensitive to the initial saturation than the van Genuchten parameters. Furthermore, with the increase of the most frequent gel/capillary pores radius, the sensitivity of the chloride ion penetration to capillary pores radius under different chloride binding conditions is increasing.", "authors": "[\"Yafen Zhang\", \"Ruonan Liu\", \"Ruicheng Zhang\", \"Xiaoyu Yan\", \"Zhuo Zhao\", \"Yu-long Zhu\"]", "venue": "Iranian Journal of Science and Technology: Transactions of Civil Engineering", "year": 2024, "date": null, "relevance_score": 1.0, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": null, "file_size": null, "source": "semantic_scholar", "oa_status": "fulltext_pdf", "topic": null, "full_content": null}

The present research investigates the potential of corrosion inhibitors to enhance the durability and strength of concrete structures, with a focus on their long-term effectiveness in resisting corrosion in reinforced concrete structures. Multiple approaches such as inhibitors, repairing processes, and coatings have been explored to prevent concrete corrosion damage, with an emphasis on concrete corrosion performance in coastal and corrosive situations. This study investigates the effect of six different corrosion inhibitors (zinc oxide, magnesium oxide, urea, sodium nitrate, sodium molybdate, and diethyl ether) on the compressive strength and durability of concrete samples. The compressive strength is assessed using both destructive (28 days cube compressive strength) and non-destructive (Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity) test methods, while concrete durability is evaluated using the rapid chloride permeability test (RCPT). The compressive strength of the admixture incorporated samples are found to be higher than the control sample by almost 50% and above with excellent concrete quality. The RCPT values of inhibitor-incorporated samples are moderate and low with control samples having high permeability even in adverse conditions of freezing, thawing, and deicing. The samples incorporated with inhibitors also show less negative half-cell potential which is 1.43 times less than that of the control sample indicating the lesser probability of occurrence of corrosion.

This study explores how Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs) fly ash, silica fume, ground granulated blast furnace slag, and metakaolin collectively improve corrosion resistance and durability. A rigorous experimental regime, including compressive strength testing, water absorption, sorptivity, rapid chloride penetration tests, sulphate attack resistance, half-cell potential measurements, chloride diffusion assessments, and linear polarization resistance tests, was implemented. Multi-SCM mixtures significantly outperformed individual SCMs, exhibiting a 68% drop in chloride permeability, 64% less sulphate-induced expansion, and an 81% reduction in steel corrosion relative to conventional concrete. Notably, mix M13 achieved exceptional microstructural refinement and a compressive strength of 70.7 MPa 38% higher than the control alongside superior resistance to aggressive ions. However, this enhanced SCM content led to noticeable workability issues, reducing slump values by approximately 38%. Although the introduction of superplasticizers partially mitigated these drawbacks, practical implementation at a larger scale remains challenging. Further, uncertainties persist regarding long-term real-world performance, necessitating additional field validations. Ultimately, while SCM blends clearly offer substantial durability advantages, future investigations should prioritize optimizing mix proportions, addressing workability concerns, and verifying laboratory results in actual exposure conditions.

Corrosion undermines the protective alkalinity of concrete, initiating electrochemical reactions that generate expansive rust products, causing cracking, delamination, and spalling of cover concrete.

In the present work, an experimental program was carried out to evaluate the long-term effects of chloride attack on the post-cracking behavior of RSFRC by performing splitting tensile tests and round panel tests. Two RSFRC mixtures defined based on the packing density optimization were produced with a fiber content of 0.8% and 1% per volume of concrete. The influence of different periods of chloride immersion was investigated, as well as the influence of fiber dispersion at crack surfaces of the specimens. Additionally, a simplified prediction of the long-term chloride penetration depth into uncracked RSFRC under immersion aggressive chloride exposure conditions was estimated. The RSFRC revealed high susceptibility to surface corrosion under the chloride exposure conditions adopted. However, the post-cracking resistance of RSFRC was not significant affected. The addition of RSF had a negligible effect in the diffusion of chloride ions into concrete, and the critical chloride content was higher than that found in conventional reinforced concrete structures.", "authors": "[\"Cristina Fraz\\u00e3o\", \"J.

This paper proposed a calculation method for designing the flexural capacity and deflection of the normal section of FIT-RC beam, and summarized the high temperature relationship among thermal parameters, thermal stress, and thermal strain of FIT-RC material. In our experiment, four-point bending test was performed on the RC beams and the results showed that the bearing capacity of FIT-RC beam is equivalent to that of conventional reinforced concrete (CRC) beam, the failure modes of the two kinds of RC beams are basically the same. At high temperatures, the similarity of mechanical performance of concrete components with different reduction ratios is related to the similarity of temperature field. With the increase of heating time, the difference in the fire resistance grade of concrete components with different reduction ratios decreases to the minimum value.

A probabilistic modelling approach using Monte Carlo simulations (MCSs) was applied to assess corrosion initiation across a range of environmental and structural conditions, including normal and high-performance concrete (HPC), varying concrete cover depths, and the use of supplementary cementing materials (SCMs). The results indicate that increasing the crack width significantly accelerates chloride ingress, reducing the time to corrosion initiation by up to 41% compared with that under uncracked conditions. HPC demonstrated superior durability, delaying corrosion initiation by nearly twice as long as normal concrete under identical chloride exposure. Elevated temperatures projected under high-emission scenarios further reduce service life by increasing chloride diffusion rates. Polynomial regression models were developed to relate crack width and concrete cover to corrosion initiation time, offering practical tools for durability-based design and service life prediction.

Despite the complicated transport mechanism of chloride ions in cementitious materials, diffusion is still the key mechanism of chloride ingress. The determination of the chloride diffusion coefficient will help to predict the chloride profile inside the cementitious materials and estimate the service life with regard to chloride-induced corrosion. However, this paper shows that the chloride diffusion coefficient in the literature is sometimes misunderstood. Such a misunderstanding results in the overestimation of the chloride resistance of cementitious materials. To clarify the chloride diffusion coefficient, this paper first presents the steady- and non-steady-state diffusion equations in cementitious materials. The factors that influence the diffusive flux are identified. The effective and apparent diffusion coefficients are then clearly explained and properly defined. We also point out the obscure definitions of the effective diffusion coefficient in the literature. The varied definitions of the effective diffusion coefficient are the result of the consideration of different factors affecting the diffusion process. Subsequently, this paper discusses two natural diffusion test methods that are frequently employed in cementitious materials to measure the chloride diffusion coefficient. The influencing factors considered by the measured diffusion coefficients are analyzed in detail. Then, the diffusion coefficients determined in some of the studies are reviewed. It is shown that three typical errors could occur when numerically determining the diffusion coefficients.", "authors": "[\"Zhiyuan Xu\", \"G.

Many factors, including materials, environments, and loading conditions, which often have uncertain characteristics, affect the performance of RC structures.

This study presents a comprehensive method for assessing the temporal reliability of reinforced concrete structures, taking into account combined effects of carbonation (general corrosion) and chloride penetration (pitting corrosion). Probabilistic models are used to capture uncertainties related to the beginning, propagation, and combined effects of corrosion on structural performance over time. The time-dependent reliability of bridge structures is evaluated using sophisticated numerical simulations in conjunction with the FORM method for reliability analysis. Both time and space variables are treated as uniformly distributed random variables within specific intervals when generating sample points. Engineers and decision-makers can assess the reliability of reinforced concrete bridges using a systematic framework that considers the complex interactions of corrosion mechanisms. This aids an informed maintenance planning and effective resource allocation to ensure long-term structural safety and durability.

The underlying mechanisms governing corrosion product precipitation in macroscopic voids and their effects on long-term durability remain unclear. Through in-situ X-ray computed tomography observations, thermodynamic and kinetic considerations, and numerical modelling of water transport within macroscopic voids, here, we provide plausible hypotheses of the processes responsible for the precipitation of corrosion products along the walls of the voids.

The characterization techniques included compressive and flexural testing; porosity, capillary water absorption, ion chloride penetration, and carbonation depth measurements; and corrosion rate monitoring via electrochemical methods. The results indicated that the addition of AF did not compromise the fresh-state properties or compressive strength but improved the flexural strength by 7.3%. Regarding durability, the porosity and water absorption increased by 4.1% and 8.2%, respectively, whereas the chloride penetration and carbonation depth remained within the requirements. Notable effects were observed regarding steel corrosion performance, where the incorporation of AF led to higher variability and an increasing trend in the corrosion rate compared with that of the reference concrete. Nevertheless, estimations suggest that abaca-fiber-reinforced concrete can meet the 100-year service life.

One of the most used methods in assessing the chloride penetration resistance of concrete is the rapid chloride migration test (RCMT). This is an expeditious and simple method but may not be representative of the chloride transport behaviour of concrete in real environment. Other methods, like immersion (IT) and wetting–drying tests (WDT), allow for a more accurate approach to reality, but are laborious and very time-consuming.

To this end, the RCMT results were compared with those obtained from the same concretes under long-term IT and WDT. A reasonable correlation between the RCMT and diffusion tests was found, when slow-reactive supplementary materials or porous lightweight aggregates surrounded by weak pastes were not considered. A poorer correlation was found when concrete was exposed under wetting–drying conditions.

In order to study the mechanical behaviors of tunnel lining structure system under the corrosive environment to rebars, first, the bending tests were performed to investigate the crack propagation behavior and structural bearing capacity of the reinforced concrete bending members degraded by corrosion. Secondly, the pull-out tests were performed to investigate the degradation of bonding strength between corroded rebars and the concrete. Finally, on the basis of the findings from the pull-out tests, a 3-D finite element bond-slip model of reinforced concrete lining structure has been established to simulate the changes of bearing capacity and durability of tunnel reinforced concrete lining under different corrosion degrees. The research has revealed: Rebar corrosion is the most important factor affecting concrete and steel corrosion. As the conversion rust rate increases, the ultimate drawing force continues to decrease. With the increase of the corrosion rate, the deflection of the specimen when it is destroyed becomes smaller, the cracking load becomes smaller and the bearing capacity also decreases. As the degree of corrosion increases, the overall deformation of the tunnel increases, and the overall safety of the lining structure decreases. The corner position is the most prone to problems after the lining structure is corroded, so pay more attention. As well, the safety of the lining structure will be basically lost when the final corrosion rate of the steel bars is greater than 30%. The findings of this research can be used to evaluate the corrosion degree of tunnel reinforced concrete lining structure and support the durability design of new tunnel concrete lining structure.", "authors": "[\"Zhiqiang Zhang\", \"R.

A very important issue, therefore, is to determine the factors affecting the durability of prestressed structures exposed to aggressive agents, especially chloride ions. The aim of this study was to verify the protective properties of concrete of prefabricated HC-type prestressed concrete slabs in order to evaluate the possibility of their application in the ceilings of multilevel garages. In this paper, the corrosion rate of rebar steel in HC-550 floor slabs at a width of 1200 mm was estimated with nondestructive electrochemical methods: linear polarization and impedance spectroscopy. The general and mechanical properties of concrete prepared according to a formula in a laboratory and analogous concrete cut directly from the analyzed floor slabs were also studied. The porosity of concrete from these slabs was determined using X-ray-computed tomography for pore-related characterization. The values of the diffusion coefficient of chloride ions determined in previous works and the previously proposed model for the overexposure of the durability of floor slabs in chloride-containing environments were used to determine the durability of these slabs. Based on the empirical correlations adopted from the literature presenting the relationship of durability/adhesion over time and the corrosion parameters studied, a safe service life was determined at the nominal class of concrete equal to Δtcor.red = 30.48 years. In addition, in the case of discontinuities in the concrete structure, there may be a dangerous reduction in the time of corrosion initiation and a subsequent reduction in service life due to the loss of the adhesion of strut strands for up to 10.68 years of service life.", "authors": "[\"Z.

By observing the microscopic of the specimens, the surface and cross-section corrosion deterioration was examined with increasing exposure time, and the physical behavior of CFRP and core concrete were discussed. The chloride ion diffusion test exerted that the chloride ion concentration in plain specimens is at least 200 times higher than that of fully reinforced specimens. Therefore, the effectiveness of CFRP reinforcement will be proved to effectively hinder the penetration of chloride ions into the core section. The formula of the time-dependent effect of concrete diffusivity with salt-freeze coupling effect was presented and its accuracy verified. A time-varying finite element model of chloride ion distribution was established by using ABAQUS software. It can be seen from the axial compression test that the strength loss rate of three categories of specimens was varied when subjected to the corrosion environment.

This study investigated the degradation characteristics of SFRC with varying fiber contents (0%, 0.35%, 0.55%, and 0.75%) and different acceleration durations, using the applied electric field acceleration method and X-ray CT tests. The experimental results revealed the characteristics of the surface crack distribution and evolution patterns in the SFRC specimens. Furthermore, the similarity between the non-uniform corrosion patterns observed in regard to accelerated corrosion under the applied electric fields and those occurring due to natural degradation was verified. The pore structure characteristics and internal crack development of the SFRC specimens were compared. The study found that the degradation process of the specimens was closely related to the fiber content. The incorporation of steel fibers altered the crack initiation and propagation modes, leading to a more scattered crack distribution. The accelerated corrosion method, employing an applied electric field, successfully simulated the non-uniform corrosion process of reinforcement in SFRC linings in subsea tunnels under natural conditions. Under the influence of a unidirectional chloride ingress source, the pronounced accumulation of corrosion products was observed only on the side of the reinforcement exposed to chloride penetration.

New research shows corrosion initiation is dominated by the presence of air voids adjacent to the reinforcement. For good concretes this is mainly a short-term transient effect. Long-term active corrosion is the direct result of the usually slow loss of concrete alkalinity, a process accelerated by chlorides. This, rather than direct chloride attack, is the cause of damaging reinforcement corrosion. It is argued also that the role of concrete cracking intersecting the reinforcement must be reconsidered.

Its superior compressive strength along with its enhanced durability, has garnered growing interest across the globe. UHPFRC's ability to withstand aggressive conditions and its high resistance to abrasion and corrosion make it particularly suitable for applications demanding long-term performance. Experiments carried out on UHPFRC has revealed a compressive strength greater than 150MPa. The choice of fibers, their quantity, alignment, and length are crucial factors that shape the mechanical characteristics of UHPFRC. UHPFRC has gained notable notoriety as a versatile material that can be tailored to suit specific project needs as its mechanical properties can be modified to match the requirements of the intended application. Developing sustainable structures is essential for advancing Zambia's energy sector, particularly in the construction and rehabilitation of dams, with a specific focus on large-scale hydroelectric power facilities like the Kariba Dam. Because of the damage in its significant parts, such as the plunge pool and sluice gates, the Kariba Dam is now in a dangerous state that needs urgent rehabilitation. The continued operation of the Kariba Dam depends heavily on timely rehabilitation efforts to address aging infrastructure and environmental wear. Traditional concrete often exhibits limitations that require frequent repairs and high costs. UHPFRC has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional concrete due to its superior mechanical properties, durability, and reduced environmental footprint. The study compares UHPFRC with conventional concrete, highlighting the benefits and limitations of each material in dam rehabilitation. By analyzing the Kariba Dam Rehabilitation Project (KDRP), the paper explores how Ultra-High-Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) could offer a superior alternative to conventional concrete. It discusses the material's characteristics, its advantages in terms of structural performance and longevity, and the economic and environmental implications.

In order to investigate chloride migration in cracked concrete, considering the mesoscopic heterogeneity of concrete, concrete modeled here is treated as a four-phase composite consisting aggregate, mortar, crack, and interfacial transition zone (ITZ). In this paper, two-dimensional finite element models of cracked concrete with different crack widths and crack quantity are established and the control parameters are determined based on the nonsteady-state chloride migration (NSSCM) test. In addition, based on the concrete finite element models, influences of crack width, crack quantity, and erosion time on chloride migration behaviors and characteristics are studied. Furthermore, a prediction model of chloride concentration on the simulated surface of a rebar in concrete influenced by different crack states is established. This model is used to derive the corrosion current density and corrosion depth prediction models of a rebar in this paper, which can be used by engineers to estimate the migration behaviors of chloride and rebar corrosion degree in RC structures in a short time and evaluate the duration of RC structures after knowing the status of cracks and chloride diffusion sources.", "authors": "[\"Yongchun Cheng\", \"Yuwei Zhang\", \"Chunli Wu\", \"Yubo Jiao\"]", "venue": "Advances in Materials Science and Engineering", "year": 2018, "date": null, "relevance_score": 1.0, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": "cc-by", "file_size": null, "source": "semantic_scholar", "oa_status": "publisher", "topic": null, "full_content": null}

Although many studies are available on the physical and mechanical characterisation of concrete containing RAP, little is still known about how medium- to long-term durability performances are affected by the partial or total replacement of natural aggregates with RAP aggregate. In this experimental study, several durability-related properties were assessed, with the aim of investigating the possible use of RAP as partial or total replacement of natural aggregates for reinforced concrete applications. In particular, concretes were obtained with increasing RAP contents (from reference mixtures with natural aggregate only, to complete substitution with RAP aggregate), two different cement types (Portland-limestone and pozzolanic), and two water/cement ratios (0.45 and 0.65), representative of two exposure classes for chloride and carbonation induced corrosion. Water sorptivity through capillary suction and water absorption were investigated, together with the resistance to the penetration of carbonation, both under accelerated and natural exposure, and the resistance to the penetration of chlorides, under natural diffusion. Relationships between physical and mechanical properties, such as total open porosity and compressive strength, and durability-related properties were also investigated. Results showed that sorptivity experienced a neat decrease for increasing RAP contents, due to the hydrophobic nature of RAP aggregate, while water absorption was less affected. Resistance to the penetration of carbonation and chlorides were both more clearly affected by other mix design variables, such as w/c ratio and cement type, rather than RAP content.", "authors": "[\"Nicoletta Russo\", \"Andrea Filippi\", \"M.

This study aimed to enhance concrete durability and long-term resilience by incorporating shrinking chitosan-based fibers. Two types of fibers were used: active fibers, which shrink upon initiation of the curing cycle in concrete, and passive fibers, which served as experimental controls and were pre-shrunk before being added. Two types of durability tests were conducted: freeze-thaw and chloride penetration. Fiber ratios of 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, and 2 wt%, along with a 0 wt% control, were used for freeze-thaw testing, while ratios of 0.24 wt%, 0.36 wt%, 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, and 2 wt% were used for chloride penetration. Results demonstrated significant durability improvements with active fibers. Active fiber-reinforced concrete exhibited over 200% greater freeze-thaw durability than passive fibers and over 500% compared to non-reinforced concrete. Chloride penetration testing revealed reduced penetration rates in active fiber concrete. After saltwater exposure, active fiber-reinforced concrete showed up to 59% higher resistance than passive fibers and 249% compared to the control group.

A large number of studies that were conducted earlier focused mainly on the mechanical properties and some durability aspects of industrial waste-based AABs. However, chloride migration and diffusion causing reinforcement corrosion in AAB-based concrete (AAC) have not been thoroughly investigated. The present study focuses on the durability of AAC produced using multiple precursors that included industrial waste materials and natural minerals such as limestone powder (LSP), red mud (RM), silicomanganese fume (SMF), and natural pozzolan (NP) activated by alkali. Firstly, the dosages of all four precursors were optimized through trials and then NP was partially replaced by 10, 20 and 30% OPC to enhance the performance of the AABs. The AAC mixtures were prepared and cured under different conditions and tested for compressive strength and durability characteristics related to chloride permeability, chloride migration, chloride diffusion, and chloride-induced reinforcement corrosion to evaluate the performances of the mixtures. The results show that the composition of the AABs and curing regimes significantly influenced the performance of the AAC. The inclusion of the OPC resulted in a very significant enhancement of the strength and durability characteristics of the AAC. In addition, there is a sharp increase in the performance of the AAC mixtures when the OPC content of the precursor was increased from 10 to 20%, irrespective of the curing method. Therefore, an optimum dosage of the OPC in the precursor can be considered as 20%, allowing utilization of 80% waste materials and natural minerals as the precursor with much higher strength and durability characteristics than traditional OPC concrete, thus saving energy and reducing environmental pollution leading to a cleaner production of concrete. Lastly, electrochemically measured corrosion potential (Ecorr) and corrosion current density (Icorr) values for the reinforcing bars (rebars) embedded in AAC mixtures were found to be misleading, as confirmed by visual inspection of the extracted rebars in addition to gravimetric test results. Hence, there is a need for further research to develop corrective measures before the utilization of the electrochemical-reinforced corrosion monitoring methods in the case of AACs.", "authors": "[\"Ibrahim N.

Generally, the durability studies include non-destructive testing such as ultrasonic pulse velocity, electrical resistivity, porosity measurement, and capillary absorption rate. These techniques make it possible to characterize the concrete and obtain information such as the total volume of pores, susceptibility to corrosion of the reinforcing steel, decrease in mechanical resistance, cracks, presence of humidity, and aggressive ions inside the concrete.

This study assessed the effectiveness of using a commercial corrosion inhibitor on steel re-bars embedded in types of concrete with different chloride percentages, using electrochemical methods to measure the corrosion rate and potential. The results indicate that, in the absence of corrosion inhibitors, corrosion rates become unacceptable with chloride percentages equal to or higher than 0.8% by weight of cement. The application of inhibitors significantly reduced the corrosion rate, particularly at chloride percentages of 0.8% and 1.2%, maintaining the re-bars in a passive state or at moderate levels of corrosion.

Through 0–100 days immersion experiments, it examines the mass and tensile property (tensile strength, elastic modulus, and ultimate strain) changes of the two types of bars, and uses the Arrhenius model, power function model, and exponential model to predict their long-term performance. Testing showed that after 100 days of immersion, BFRP bars had a mass loss rate of just 0.99%, compared to 3.83% for rebars. The minimum tensile strength retention rate of BFRP bars was 98.24%, versus 91.00% for rebars. The minimum elastic modulus retention rate of BFRP bars was 95.27%, while rebars only retained 92.25%. Thus, BFRP bars exhibited 7.24% and 3.02% higher tensile strength and elastic modulus retention rates, respectively, than rebars. Experimental results demonstrated that BFRP bars possess superior corrosion resistance to rebars in concrete pore fluids simulating a marine environment.

This study investigates the application of electromechanical impedance (EMI) techniques using piezoelectric sensors for the real-time assessment of corrosion-induced damage and the prognosis of remaining service life in RC structures. By leveraging the sensitivity of EMI-based methods, this research aims to develop predictive models for quantifying corrosion severity and structural deterioration without direct physical measurements of corrosion parameters. The study examines chloride-induced and carbonation-induced corrosion mechanisms, emphasizing their impact on reinforcement integrity. The EMI technique is employed to monitor corrosion progression by analysing variations in mechanical impedance, which serves as a reliable indicator of structural degradation. Structural parameters such as stiffness and mass loss are extracted from impedance signatures to establish predictive models for corrosion assessment. The stiffness-based model enables phase-wise classification of corrosion progression, while the mass loss model facilitates the estimation of corrosion rates and corresponding reductions in rebar cross-section and structural load-carrying capacity. Experimental validation is conducted using RC specimens subjected to accelerated corrosion conditions, demonstrating the efficacy of EMI-based techniques in accurately assessing corrosion severity. The results establish a strong correlation between impedance-derived parameters and actual structural deterioration, enabling reliable service life estimation. By providing a non-destructive, real-time monitoring framework, the proposed approach offers a viable alternative to conventional electrochemical methods, facilitating proactive maintenance and extending the service life of RC structures.

This research examines the impact of nano-titanium dioxide (NT) on the concrete properties. NT was incorporated in varying dosages (0.5%, 1%, and 1.5% by weight of the cement) to assess its impact on strength, toughness, and resilience. The results demonstrated a significant enhancement in mechanical properties, with a peak compressive strength of 65.20 ± 1.03 MPa, a split tensile strength of 3.44 ± 0.17 MPa, and a flexural strength of 9.5 ± 0.47 MPa at a 1.5% NT dosage after 28 days of curing. Furthermore, the long-term performance was notable, as the compressive strength further increased to 75.25 ± 1.10 MPa at 180 days, confirming the sustained strength-gain potential of NT-incorporated concrete. Also, durability assessments were conducted under aggressive conditions, including exposure to 4% NaCl, HCl, and H2SO4 for 90 days. Additional tests, including rapid chloride penetrability test (RCPT), surface resistivity, freeze-thaw resistance, and accelerated carbonation, were conducted to assess long-term durability along with its economic feasibility. The NT-incorporated concrete demonstrated enhanced resistance to chloride ingress, acid attack, and elevated temperatures (200–600 °C), with improved modulus of elasticity and fire resistance. Furthermore, durability assessments revealed a noteworthy contrast, i.e., while resistivity tests classified NT-incorporated concretes as having ‘very low’ chloride penetrability, RCPT values remained in the ‘moderate’ category. This divergence underscores the need for multiple durability indices in evaluating nano-concretes. Microstructural analyses using scanning electron microscopy confirmed the densification effect of NT, leading to a refined pore structure and improved bond efficiency within the cementitious matrix. Moreover, economic analysis confirms the economic viability of nano-titanium concrete, demonstrating significant long-term savings through service life extension despite higher initial investment.

The pH and chemical compositions of the condensed liquid that adhered to the tower’s inner face and the macromorphology, compressive strength, and neutralization depth of in situ specimens were tested periodically. In addition, a finite element numerical simulation was conducted to simulate and verify the concentration distributions of CO2 and SO2 in the flue gas in the cooling tower. The results showed that the cleaned flue gas was enveloped, diluted, and uplifted by hot vapor in the cooling tower, and its concentration decreased. Meanwhile, the effective diffusion radius increased gradually as the flue gas rose. With the same elevation in the cooling tower, the concentration of flue gas decreased rapidly from the central point to the surrounding area. The air near the inner surface of the cooling tower was merely dampened air with a low concentration of acidic gas due to the gigantic diameter of the cooling tower.

To assess the corrosion inhibition behavior of the Neem natural organic extract, three inorganic commercial inhibitors were tested to compare following the criteria established by Stratful for half-cell potential under a simulated chloride environment. Moreover, the effect of concrete integrity by the Neem treatment was recorded after different temperature conditions, slump, weight alteration, air content, compressive strength, and chloride-ions penetration.

Extending the lifespan of concrete is highly efficient in achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Biomineralization for concrete corrosion inhibition (BCCI) was previously proposed and demonstrated to effectively protect marine concrete in laboratory experiments, showing promise for decarbonization due to potentially increased lifespans. The potential of BCCI for decarbonization and sustainability warrants further investigation. Therefore, this study evaluated its impact on GHG emissions for insights into global decarbonization. Field corrosion experiments were conducted to ascertain its effectiveness as a valuable GHG calculation input, including biofilm community analysis and microstructure and macroscopic measurements of concrete. Results show that BCCI decreased the total/relative abundances of corrosive bacteria, inhibited sulfate and chloride diffusion, and enhanced carbon functions, irrespective of concrete type. Moreover, BCCI significantly reduced GHG emissions, particularly in 20 MPa concrete. BCCI demonstrated substantial GHG mitigation potential in China, Indonesia, and the USA, which enabled a competitive 37–65% reduction in global GHG from producing underwater concrete.

Recent research findings based on observations from actual bridge performance and specially conducted long-term experiments for a wide variety of concretes indicate that chloride concentrations are involved only indirectly in initiating reinforcement corrosion and in serious active corrosion. For high quality concretes the critical aspect for long-term durability is the loss of concrete alkalinity, i.e. the acid neutralising capacity of the concrete, principally imparted by its cement content. Alkalinity is reduced, normally very slowly, by the rate of dissolution of calcium hydroxide. However, it is increased by chlorides. It is also increased by a greater internal surface area available for dissolution, such as in poor quality, porous, concretes. Only when the concrete pH drops sufficiently, to a level set by chemical thermodynamic conditions, will large-scale reinforcement corrosion be possible. Importantly, cracking of concrete cover through to the reinforcing bars is likely to cause accelerated localised loss of alkalinity, and thus severe very localised corrosion. Several examples of this are given, drawn from practical reinforced concrete structures. These observations have serious implications for serviceability inspections and for predicting remaining structural life.", "authors": "[\"R. Melchers\", \"I.

The incorporation of basalt fiber materials into concrete helps to improve the durability of concrete. In this paper, experiments were conducted to study the corrosion deterioration mechanisms of basalt fiber-reinforced cast-in-situ concrete under sulfate, chloride, and combined attack. The appearance, size, mass, flexural, and compressive strength of specimens were investigated during the immersion period to determine the changes in the physical and mechanical properties of specimens. Moreover, the microstructure and mineral changes of specimens during the immersion period were observed by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Thermogravimetric (TG)/ Derivative Thermogravimetric (DTG) analyses. Results show that premixed chloride has a significant detrimental influence on the strength development of cast-in-situ concrete, with concrete powder spalling occurring on the surface of the specimen. Severe corrosion degradation of specimens occurs under the external sulfate and internal chloride combined attack, resulting in lower flexural and compressive strength. The compressive strength and flexural strength of the corroded specimens decreased by 15.4% and 24.8%, respectively, compared with the control group at 28 days. Moreover, premixed basalt fiber has a beneficial influence on cast-in-situ concrete. When the basalt fiber content is 0.5%, the flexural strength of the specimen is increased by 16.2%. The filling and bridging effect of basalt fiber alleviates the negative effects caused by corrosion. In addition, increasing fiber content is beneficial for enhancing its effectiveness when the fiber content is less than 0.5%. This paper provides a valuable reference for the application of basalt fiber-reinforced cast-in-situ concrete under the condition of sulfate–chloride compound corrosion.", "authors": "[\"Yiqi Hu\", \"Zhuo Wang\", \"Zhilong Chen\", \"Cheng Wang\", \"Shijun Ding\", \"Zhibao Nie\", \"Tianxin Hou\", \"Gaowen Zhao\"]", "venue": "Materials", "year": 2024, "date": null, "relevance_score": 1.0, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": "cc-by", "file_size": null, "source": "semantic_scholar", "oa_status": "publisher", "topic": null, "full_content": null}

In addition, the influence of the adopted chloride exposure conditions on the post-cracking constitutive laws of the developed RSFRC is also assessed by performing numerical simulations for the prediction of the long-term performance of RSFRC under these aggressive conditions.

This can cause local destruction and failure of buildings if obligatory measures are not taken to protect them from corrosion. This is especially true for industrial buildings, where the environment could be contaminated with aggressive products or waste. An important issue is the development of methods for calculating the load-bearing capacity and serviceability of reinforced concrete structures with corrosion damage. The main reason for this is the necessity to determine the durability and reliability of buildings and structures and the estimation of their safe operation time. As corrosion damages of concrete are a critical issue, more detailed experimental studies are needed. This paper presents experimental studies of concrete prisms under the simultaneous action of an aggressive environment and a constant level of compressive force. In total, 32 prisms under different loading conditions and in different aggressive medium were tested. Samples were divided in series, for which different load levels were chosen (0.25fck, 0.35fck, 0.45fck). Additionally, control samples in the air and immersed in water were tested. During the experiment, different parameters were monitored and recorded: decrease of cross-sectional size, the temperature and environmental humidity. Results of the study showed that destruction occurred due to the presence of corrosion damages of concrete and a reduction of the cross-sectional area. The stresses in the concrete at the destruction stage were less than the value of the prism strength by 10–12%. It was established that along the contour of the section, there is a partially degraded layer of concrete of 1.5–3.7 mm thickness, with corrosion microcracks and corrosion products. Additionally, experimental and theoretical diagrams of concrete with corrosion damages were obtained and compared. The ultimate deformations of concrete with corrosion damage, which correspond to the prismatic strength of concrete, in comparison with undamaged concrete were lower by 11–18%. Therefore, the concrete strength is decreased during exploitation under loading in an aggressive environment, which needs to be taken into account during calculations.", "authors": "[\"Y.

To this end, an investigation was carried out involving the placement of CSA concrete in the tidal zone of Zhairuoshan Island, Zhoushan, China, and subjected to a 20-month marine tidal exposure test. The comparison was made with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete to evaluate the effectiveness of the former. The test findings indicate that the compressive strength of both types of concrete is reduced by seawater dry-wet cycling, and the porosity of the surface concrete is increased. However, the compressive strength of CSA concrete is observed to be more stable under long-term drying–wetting cycles. When the ettringite in the CSA surface concrete is decomposed due to carbonization and alkalinity reduction, its products will react with Ca2+ and SO42− in seawater to regenerate ettringite to fill in the concrete pores, making the concrete strength more stable and hindering chlorine penetration. Furthermore, CSA concrete exhibits a higher capillary absorption capacity than OPC concrete, which results in chloride accumulation on its surface. However, the diffusion capacity of chloride in CSA concrete is significantly lower than that in OPC concrete.", "authors": "[\"Xudong Tang\", \"S.

The concrete material factors, including the water-to-cement ratio (w/c) of concrete, as well as the content, shape, particle grading, and random distribution of coarse aggregate embedded in mortar, have a marked effect on chloride transport performance within concrete. However, comprehensive consideration for the effects of both w/c and coarse aggregate performances on chloride diffusion characteristics in concrete is scarce, especially regarding the chloride diffusion model of concrete. In this paper, an indoor exposure experiment exploring chloride ions intruding into mortar and concrete specimens with w/c = 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 was carried out, in order to acquire the chloride diffusion parameters for concrete three-phases composites. Based on the numerical algorithm of random generation and placement of two-dimensional random convex polygon coarse aggregate, mesoscopic numerical models for concrete, considering various coarse aggregate contents as well as grading, were established. Using the numerical simulation method of finite element analysis for chloride transport in cement-based materials, which can replace some of the exposure tests, the influences of w/c, coarse aggregate content and grading on chloride diffusion performance in concrete mesoscopic models were systematically probed. According to the Fick’s second law, a chloride diffusion model by the consideration of w/c, volume fraction of coarse aggregate (VFCA), and maximum size of coarse aggregate (MSCA) was developed to assess the chloride concentration profiles in concrete under arbitrary w/c, coarse aggregate content, and coarse aggregate grading conditions.

After the stirrup-corroded column reached the ultimate load, the concrete cover spalled off in pieces along the corrosion-induced cracks and loading cracks, the core concrete was crushed, and the test column produced obvious brittle failure.

It is highly practical to analyze the bonding performance and thermomechanical coupling mechanism of IOT reinforced concrete. The relevant literature rarely considers the influence of temperature over the bonding performance of samples, or prepares samples from IOT concrete. There are very limited results on the similarity of the temperature field and mechanical response of reinforced concrete under high temperatures. To solve the problem, this paper constructs a bond slip curve model for the IOT-reinforced concrete interface, and provides a way to plot the mean bond slip curve, before computing the bond stress distribution, as well as local bond stress-relative slip distribution. Next, the authors summarized the thermal parameters of the IOT concrete material, and the high-temperature relationship between thermal stress and thermal strain. Finally, sixteen central pull-out tests were carried out on central pull-out samples by applying strain gages into rebar slots.

In this paper, to further inhibit steel corrosion in a high chloride environment and take advantage of the dual-functional carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), the impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) technique was applied to the hybrid-reinforced concrete beam with internally embedded CFRP bars and steel fiber reinforced polymer composite bar (SFCB) as the anode material while the steel bar was compelled to the cathode. The effect of the new ICCP system on the flexural performance of the hybrid-reinforced concrete beam subjected to corrosion was verified experimentally. First, the electricity-accelerated precorrosion test was performed for the steel bar in the hybrid-reinforced beams with a target corrosion ratio of 5%. Then, the dry–wet cycles corrosion was conducted and the ICCP system was activated simultaneously for the hybrid-reinforced concrete beam for 180 days. Finally, the three-point bending experiment was carried out for the hybrid-reinforced concrete beams. The steel bars were taken out from the concrete to quantitatively measure the corrosion ratio after flexural tests. Results showed that the further corrosion of steel bars could be inhibited effectively by the ICCP treatment with the CFRP bar and the SFCB as the anode. Additionally, the ICCP system showed an obvious effect on the flexural behavior of the hybrid-reinforced concrete beams: The crack load and ultimate load, as well as the stiffness, were enhanced notably compared with the beam without ICCP treatment. Compared with the SFCB anode, the ICCP system with the CFRP bar as the anode material was more effective for the hybrid-reinforced concrete beam to prevent the steel corrosion.", "authors": "[\"Yingwu Zhou\", \"Yaowei Zheng\", \"L.

This paper systematically studies the performance, applicability, and impact of different types of anti-corrosion coatings on concrete durability, focusing on their resistance to chloride ion penetration, freeze–thaw cycles, carbonation, and sulfate corrosion. The applicability of existing testing methods and standard systems is also evaluated. This study shows that surface-film-forming coatings can create a dense barrier, reducing chloride ion diffusion coefficients by more than 50%, making them suitable for humid and high-chloride environments. Pore-sealing coatings fill capillary pores, improving the concrete’s impermeability and making them ideal for highly corrosive environments. Penetrating hydrophobic coatings form a water-repellent layer, reducing water absorption by over 75%, which is particularly beneficial for coastal and underwater concrete structures. Additionally, composite coating technology is becoming a key approach to addressing multi-environment adaptability challenges. Experimental results have indicated that combining penetrating hydrophobic coatings with surface-film-forming coatings can enhance concrete’s resistance to chloride ion penetration while ensuring weather resistance and wear resistance. However, this study also reveals that there are several challenges in the standardization, engineering application, and long-term performance assessment of coating technology. The lack of globally unified testing standards leads to difficulties in comparing the results obtained from different test methods, affecting the practical application of these coatings in engineering. Moreover, construction quality control and long-term service performance monitoring remain weak points in their use in engineering applications. Some engineering case studies indicate that coating failures are often related to an insufficient coating thickness, improper interface treatment, or lack of maintenance. To further improve the effectiveness and long-term durability of coatings, future research should focus on the following aspects: (1) developing intelligent coating materials with self-healing, high-temperature resistance, and chemical corrosion resistance capabilities; (2) optimizing multilayer composite coating system designs to enhance the synergistic protective capabilities of different coatings; and (3) promoting the creation of global concrete coating testing standards and establishing adaptability testing methods for various environments.

In recent years of sustainable cement industry innovation, alkali-activated cement has emerged as one of the most promising alternatives to ordinary Portland cement (OPC). In terms of durability, corrosion of steel is a significant problem and has become a major cause of deterioration of reinforced concrete structures worldwide. Thus, structural health monitoring techniques are essential to monitor the corrosion in real-time to avoid unexpected failure since civil engineering structures serve as a crucial pillar of the economy. This paper presents through an experimental campaign a novel method of automatically monitoring the performance of alkali-activated concrete (AAC) and ordinary Portland cement concrete (OPCC) under chloride-induced corrosion conditions using an embedded piezo sensor (EPS) based on the electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) technique. AAC was produced using alkali silicate-activated fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag. The accelerated corrosion tests were conducted on reinforced AAC and OPCC specimens in which the EPS was attached to reinforcing steel bars inside the specimens to monitor the changes in the EMI signature during the corrosion progression. To quantify the damage due to chloride-induced corrosion, statistical damage indices such as root mean square deviation were calculated. Further, the deterioration in structural parameters was identified by extracting the equivalent structural parameters (ESPs) such as stiffness, mass and damping from the raw EMI signatures. Based on qualitative and quantitative results, it can be seen that the changes in raw signature and damage in AAC were lower than OPCC. The deterioration in term of stiffness loss was found to be 39.35% in OPCC and 12.73% in AAC. Hence, it is demonstrated that the AAC exhibits a superior corrosion resistance to OPCC.", "authors": "[\"T. Bansal\", \"V. Talakokula\", \"Sri Kalyana Rama Jyosyula\", \"R.

Optimized finely ground natural pozzolan was employed as 6% of partial substitution of the cement. Polypropylene fibers with 6 mm and 12 mm lengths were introduced individually for a volume fraction of 0.1% and 0.15% respectively. Then, in combination with a total fiber content of 0.25%. The effect of sodium chloride attack on the performance of concretes was assessed through the measurement of the compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, sorptivity, rapid chloride permeability test, apparent and intrinsic gas permeability, and visual inspection at various testing ages (28, 90, 180, and 365 days). A total of four (04) types of concretes were cast: one (01) High-Performance Concrete (HPC), and three (03) High-Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete (HPFRC) stored in tap water and sodium chloride environment. From the experiments performed, it can be concluded that the polypropylene fibers introduction into HPC favorably affect its chemical resistance to chloride attack and long-term durability. The difference in the permeability of HPC and HPFRC stored in tap water and chloride environment is not significant. Furthermore, the visual investigation of HPFRC after 365 days of immersion in sodium chloride environment showed no sign of degradation.

Cracking fundamentally alters transport, allowing rapid chloride and carbon dioxide ingress, which undermines passivity and accelerates corrosion. Self-healing concrete technologies aim to autonomously restore transport barriers and reestablish electrochemical stability. This review critically synthesizes evidence on healing effectiveness for corrosion mitigation through a dual framework of barrier restoration and interface stabilization, integrating depth-resolved chloride profiles with electrochemical performance indices. Critically, visual crack closure proves an unreliable indicator of corrosion protection. Healing mechanisms exhibit characteristic spatial signatures: autogenous and microbial approaches preferentially seal surface zones with diminishing effectiveness at reinforcement depth, while encapsulated low-viscosity polymers achieve greater depth continuity. However, electrochemical recovery consistently lags transport recovery, with healed specimens achieving only partial restoration of intact corrosion resistance. Recovery effectiveness depends on crack geometry, moisture conditions, and healing mechanism characteristics, with systems performing effectively only within narrow, condition-specific windows. Effective corrosion protection requires coordinated barrier and interface strategies targeting both bulk transport and steel surface chemistry. The path forward demands rigorous field validation emphasizing electrochemical outcomes over appearance metrics, long-term durability assessment, and performance-based verification frameworks to enable predictable service life extension.", "authors": "[\"Segun J.

Therefore, to evaluate the service life of the strengthened beams, this study investigates the behavior of precracked RC beams strengthened with CFRP sheets exposed to marine environment. Accelerated ageing experiments were carried out by exposing specimens to cyclic wetting in sea water and drying in 40°C air for 3 months and 6 months, respectively. After the environment exposure, four-point bending test was conducted and then the diffusion of chlorides in the strengthened beams was analysed. The results show that the bonding behavior of the adhesive was weakened and the ductility of the strengthened beams was slightly reduced due to the marine environment. But there is no obvious strength difference between the strengthened beams suffered from marine environment for 3 months and 6 months. Besides, the precracks in the RC beams accelerated the chloride diffusion, while CFRP bonding reduced the chloride penetration.

The transport characteristics of chloride salts in concrete under the coupling condition of load and erosion environment are studied by means of creep tester. The loadbearing levels of specimens are divided into four groups according to the design values of ultimate load: 0%, 20%, 40% and 60%. The transport of chloride ions in concrete in marine environment is simulated by dry-wet cycling method. The results show that the existence of compressive stress accelerates the chloride ion transport in concrete at the initial stage of loading, and the higher the stress level, the faster the chloride ion transport. With the increase of loading time, the stress hinders the transport process of chloride ion. In the same period, the transmission efficiency in concrete without stress is the highest. In the same period, the chloride ion concentration on the surface gradually decreases with the compressive stress level. The longer the time, the more obvious the downward trend. The peak chloride ion content has little change with the increase of the compressive stress level; at the same compressive stress level, the chloride ion diffusion coefficient is basically unchanged with the increase of the dry-wet cycle; in the same cycle, the chloride ion diffusion coefficient increases with the increase of the stress level, but does not show a linear relationship.

Chloride ingress occurs through the porous structure of concrete, making permeability control crucial for enhancing structural longevity. Fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) is widely used to improve durability; however, the effects of different fiber types on chloride resistance remain unclear. This study examines the influence of glass and polypropylene fibers on concrete’s microstructure and chloride penetration resistance. Cylindrical specimens were prepared, including a reference mix without fibers and mixes with 0.25% and 0.50% fiber content by volume. Both fiber types were tested for chloride resistance. The accelerated non-steady-state migration method was employed to determine the resistance coefficients to chloride ion penetration, while X-ray macrofluorescence (MacroXRF) mapped the chlorine infiltration depth in the samples. Compressive strength decreased in all fiber-reinforced samples, with 0.50% glass fiber leading to a 56% reduction in strength. Nevertheless, the XRF results showed that a 0.25% fiber content significantly reduced chloride penetration, with polypropylene fibers outperforming glass fibers.

ECE is accomplished by applying an electric field between a temporary external anode and the reinforcing steel (the cathode) which causes the migration of negatively charged chloride ions in the concrete away from the steel towards the positively charged anode. Since the early 1990’s hundreds of reinforced concrete structures worldwide, including the USA and Canada, have been treated with ECE. Majority of these structures in the USA has been installed through funding from the Federal Highway Administration.

When corrosion starts at a given location, the steel of the adjacent regions remains in its passive state; therefore corrosion initiation is delayed in those regions due to the negative shift in potential. Introduction of threshold dependence on potential is a critical need for accurate forecasting, as neglecting that phenomenon can lead to erroneously high damage projections. An earlier investigation incorporated this issue in a one-dimensional deterministic model solved by a finite difference method evaluating a partially submerged reinforced concrete column. While the model served to demonstrate feasibility of the concept, damage prediction was found to be highly sensitive to the corrosion activation zone size. As the number of nodes used for the model increased, resulting in smaller activation zones, the total predicted amount of damage at a given age decreased. Examination of the model assumptions suggested that the problem stemmed from neglecting the local resistance of the concrete around the steel bars. An improvement has been developed here by implementing a formulation that accounts for the local resistance polarization associated with the selection of the size of activation zone. The damage projections for the smaller node separation resulted in a finite limiting value. Comparison with a case where the effect of local resistance polarization in the activation zone size is neglected is presented.", "authors": "[\"Andrea N. S\\u00e1nchez\", \"Alberto A.

During short-term loading, the load was applied in steps with a 10-minute exposure at each step to failure or to a predetermined level of a continuously acting load. In the interval between the steps, the process of cracking was tracked. After reaching a given level of loading, the load was fixed and maintained unchanged with a spring cassette for 300 days. Deformations were measured using strain gauges and dial gauges. Deflections and relative deformations of the extreme upper and extreme lower fibers for three types of beams are determined. It has been established that stabilization of deflections in beams from steel fiber concrete occurs much earlier (100 days) than in beams made of ordinary concrete (175 days).

In addition to the study of flexural capacity, the prediction of the flexural behaviour of corroded beams was studied through the stiffness effects of reinforcement corrosion. The stiffness study indicated a sharp drop in stiffness at relatively low degrees of corrosion, followed by a slower decline at increasing levels of corrosion.

Tunnel structures experiencing water leakages are not only old, but also new in some case. The concrete tunnels structures located underwater are generally protected by waterproof membranes as the first defense to prevent water leakages and rebar corrosion. However, once water leakage occurs, the corrosion mechanism is quite different from other concrete structures which are exposed to marine or de-icing salt environments. When rebars corrode in concrete, the accumulating corrosion products develop expansive force and crack the concrete. When the concrete cracks grow, the concrete spalls and falls to the roadway. For the based slab, concrete spalls create potholes on the driveway. Therefore, it is important to clearly understand the corrosion condition of the rebars in the tunnel caused by salt water leakage.

Typical design lives of metallic and concrete transit structures are required to exceed 75 y, with exposure to de-icing salts, freeze/thaw, and the potential for stray currents. Measures to mitigate the risks of reinforcement corrosion to rail structures have progressed over the last century, with some diversion between the preferred practices in Europe and North America. One significant difference with large cost impacts on projects is the means and methods to achieve continuity of the reinforcing steel within rail structures to control stray currents to negligible levels. Herein we review the available standards and literature as it relates to the risks of stray current corrosion of reinforcing steel, specifically with respect to the requirement for welding reinforcing. Field measurements of steel resistivity taken during the construction of rail structures are presented to clarify the as-built condition.

Ensuring of the joint operation of the reinforced structure and the reinforcement structures is a key factor for successful reinforcement of structures. Traditional methods of ensuring of the joint operation are not always applicable in practice. One possible method is to create concrete keys in the reinforced structure and transfer forces from them to steel key plates fixed on the reinforcement structures (beams) or vice versa (columns). Aim. To illustrate the application of the method under consideration, we used the example of reinforcing of the monolithic reinforced concrete beams and steel columns. Materials and methods. The reinforcement was carried out using modern construction materials, including Mapei construction chemicals, and modern methods, including laser cleaning of the surface of steel structures from corrosion products. Results. It was found that the application of the method under consideration does not require unique qualifications from the performer, and the method is quite effective. The inclusion of reinforcement structures is indirectly confirmed by the results of structure monitoring, but due to the operating conditions of the structures, they have not been tested (including failure test). Conclusions. The method discussed in the article can be recommended for use in difficult conditions. However, it is necessary to conduct an experimental verification by testing the structures to failure.", "authors": "[\"Sergey I. Ivanov\", \"Evgeny N. Pankov\", \"Alexander A.

The novelty of this work in the use of a green inhibitor—orange peel extract. The analysis was based on an experimental investigation of the samples with time of immersion in 3.5 wt% NaCl aqueous solutions at room temperature according to European Standards. For this study, different mixtures of concrete were prepared by adding two types of superplastisizers and green inhibitors in different concentrations. The results of the Cl− ions test showed that all the samples (except sample C2) after an immersion testing period of 6 months contained Cl− ions in high concentrations, indicating a greater risk of corrosion. Sample C2 (with green inhibitor and Oxydtron superplasticizer) showed the highest resistance against the chloride ion ingress measured by following the Cl− concentration changes up to the end of the 6 months testing period. This samples' good resistance to corrosion in the tested environment was also proved by the results of several sets of measurements of the electrical resistivity and half‐cell potentials carried on the concrete test samples.", "authors": "[\"Shaymaa A.

Also considered were examples where the admixed corrosion inhibitor calcium nitrite (CN) was present. By superimposing the limiting [Cl-] for CN effectiveness, as reported in the literature, upon the CDF([Cl-]) trends, the percentage of reinforcement elements for which this [Cl-] had been reached/exceeded was determined. Further, by employing a Load Resistance Factor Design type analysis, the percentage of elements for which corrosion initiation occurs was projected. In the present effort, the added consideration of diffusional inhibitor egress over time is taken into account; and the same determinations (percentage of elements for which, first, the critical [Cl-] has been reached/exceeded and, second, active corrosion has initiated) were made.

Calcium carbonate formation was detected only in the outermost 10 mm to 15 mm. However, alkali loss and concrete pH reduction extended much further inward but reinforcement corrosion was not observed. Theoretical thermodynamic conditions dictate that corrosion initiation of reinforcement can result only from the long-term dissolution and loss by leaching of calcium hydroxide from the concrete matrix. These appear rate-limited by the barrier effect of carbonated concrete. These interpretations provide a new model for “carbonation” initiation of reinforcement corrosion.

In most cases, one of the dominant destruction processes is taken into account – either carbonization or chloride penetration. Experimental results and field observations show that this is an unrealistic approach. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method for determining the durability of concrete under combined impacts, i. e. with the penetration of chlorides into it and mechanical load. The paper describes in detail an experimental method for studying the effect of mechanical load on the penetration of chlorides into the pore space of cement-based materials. A test method is presented that makes it possible to determine realistic diffusion coefficients of chloride ions in concrete under compressive or tensile stress. As a result of the experiments carried out, it has been determined that the combination of mechanical loads and environmental influences can be much more significant than just environmental influence without the influence of mechanical loading. In fact, the service life of reinforced concrete structures depends on many possible combinations of mechanical loads and environmental influences, including freeze-thaw cycles. Thus, cracks formed during freeze-thaw cycling should be taken into account in tests of combined environmental and mechanical stress in order to better understand and systematically describe the effect of such exposure on the durability of concrete. For reliable prediction of the service life of reinforced concrete structures, it is also necessary to take into account the influence of the applied cyclic stress.", "authors": "[\"S.

To investigate the serviceability and durability of the main girders and CFCC, three full-scale test girders were fabricated in 1988. At the same time, a bending experiment was conducted on one girder to investigate the ultimate behavior, load carrying capacity of the PC girder, as well the strain behavior of the CFCC.

An accurate simulation of chloride ion diffusion in concrete is hence critical to durability design, maintenance, and reinforcement of concretes in erosive environments. To accurately simulate actual chloride ion diffusion in concretes, an improved three-dimensional neighborhood type is proposed according to the mechanism of chloride ion diffusion in concrete, and a three-dimensional cellular automaton model (3D CA model) for describing the diffusion process of chloride in concrete is established based on this neighborhood type. The accuracy and correctness of simulation results obtained from the 3D CA model were verified by comparison with Fick’s second law analytical solutions. Based on the 3D CA model, an improved modified 3D CA model is developed (3D RTCA model) which takes into account random chloride ion distribution in concrete, the time dependence of the coefficient of chloride ion diffusion, and the structure stress level effect on chloride ion diffusion. Numerical simulation results reveal that the 3D RTCA model has higher calculation accuracy in predicting long-term concentration of chloride in concretes, and the simulation results are closer to experimental findings than analytical results obtained based on Fick’s second law. Compared with Fick’s second law analytical solutions, the 3D RTCA model can reflect more truly the cross-sectional stress level effect on chloride ion diffusion through simple local evolution rules. Besides, the 3D RTCA model can genuinely describe the randomness and uncertainty of the chloride diffusion process.

Portland cement is the major ingredient in\nconcrete. The main factor that does not require Portland cement or emit greenhouse gases is geopolymer. The geopolymer\ntechnique described by Davidovits (1978) as an alternative to Portland cement in concrete shows promise.

The improved properties favour its use in agressive conditions (such as marine environment) prone to corrosion. Despite the remarkable advances in the knowledge about corrosion of conventional reinforced concrete structures, questions still remain about its effects on the durability of HPSFRCC. The governing mechanisms of corrosion, the presence of cracks, the high steel fibre content, and the long-term chloride exposure still need to be properly evaluated. Given the increased application of HPSFRCC with structural responsibility and the high steel fibre content commonly used in the mixes, it is of great importance to understand the main mechanisms governing the chloride corrosion and its effects on the durability of the real-scale structures constructed with the material. To overcome these barriers and the uncertainty mentioned, this doctoral thesis adresses the following key issues: the effect of chlorides in uncracked HPSFRCCs under constant conditions; the influence of chloride corrosion in uncracked HPSFRCCs under wet-dry cycles with chlorides; the effect of corrosion in pre-cracked HPSFRCCs subjected to the same cycles and the proposal of a simplified model to consider the structural effects of corrosion. The first subject concerns the assessment of chloride corrosion on the aesthetic aspect and on the mechanical behaviour of HPSFRCCs by means of an accelerated test. For that, HPSFRCCs specimens with and without chlorides added to the mixes and with different fibre contents were tested. The preliminary experimental programme shows that, in general, the chlorides produce a level of surface corrosion with aesthetic consequences but have small influence on the mechanical performance. In the second subject, the influence of cycles was assessed in accelerated tests with uncracked HPSFRCCs prisms. The results reveal that, for uncracked HPSFRCCs elements, the corrosion affects the surface aspect but has no influence on the post-cracking response. The third subject focuses on the analysis of pre-cracked HPSFRCCs prisms under cyclic chloride exposure, considering different pre-crack widths and fibre contents. The study shows that the corrosion affects significantly the mechanical behaviour of the fibres for all specimens. The last subject covers a proposal of a simplified model to consider the effect of corrosion in the ULS design of HPSFRCC elements under cyclic chloride exposure. The model proposed was capable of reproducing the influence of the corrosion process over the cycles, being compatible with the current philosophy proposed in codes for the design of HPSFRCC structures.\n Los compuestos cementicios de alta resistencia reforzados con fibra de acero (CCARRFA) muestran un mayor rendimiento estructural y durabilidad. Las mejoras en las propiedades del CCARRFA debido a la inclusión de fibras de acero favorecen su uso en condiciones agresivas (tales como el ambiente marino) propensas a la corrosión. A pesar de los notables avances en el estudio de la corrosión de estructuras de hormigón armado, aún quedan cuestiones sin resolver respecto a sus efectos en la durabilidad del CCARRFA. En relación a ello, los mecanismos que gobiernan la corrosión, la presencia de fisuras, el alto contenido de fibra de acero y la exposición prolongada a los cloruros deben ser evaluados adecuadamente. \nDado el aumento de la utilización de CCARRFA con responsabilidad estructural y el alto contenido de fibra de acero comúnmente utilizado en las mezclas, resulta de gran importancia comprender los principales mecanismos que gobiernan la corrosión, así como sus efectos en la durabilidad de estructuras a escala real construidas con este material. Para superar estas barreras y las incertidumbres mencionadas, esta tesis doctoral tratará los siguientes aspectos clave: el efecto de los cloruros en CCARRFA no fisurado en condiciones constantes; la influencia de la corrosión por cloruros en CCARRFA no fisurado sometido a ciclos de mojado y secado con cloruros; el efecto de la corrosión en CCARRFA fisurados sometidos a los mismos ciclos y una propuesta de modelo simplificado para considerar los efectos estructurales de la corrosión. \nEl primer aspecto aborda la evaluación de la corrosión por cloruros desde un punto de vista estético y del comportamiento mecánico del CCARRFA mediante un ensayo acelerado. Para ellos, se han ensayado probetas de CCARRFA con y sin cloruros añadidos a las mezclas con diferentes contenidos de fibra. La campaña experimental preliminar mostró que, en general, los cloruros producen un nivel de corrosión superficial con consecuencias estéticas, pero con poca influencia en el comportamiento mecánico. En el segundo aspecto, se evaluó la influencia de los ciclos en ensayos acelerados en probetas de CCARRFA no fisuradas. Los resultados revelaron que en los elementos de CCARRFA no fisurados la corrosión afecta al aspecto superficial pero no influye en la respuesta post-fisuración. \nEl tercer aspecto trata el análisis de probetas de CCARRFA fisuradas con diferentes anchos de fisura y contenidos de fibra sometidas a una exposición cíclica de cloruros. El estudio muestra que la corrosión afecta significativamente al comportamiento mecánico de las fibras de todas las probetas. El último aspecto se centra en la propuesta de uno modelo simplificado que considera el efecto de la corrosión en el diseño en ELU de elementos de CCARRFA bajo una exposición cíclica de cloruros. El modelo propuesto es capaz de reproducir el efecto del proceso de la corrosión a lo largo de los ciclos, siendo compatible con la actual filosofía propuesta en códigos para el diseño de estructuras de CCARRFA.", "authors": "[\"M.

Various types of sustainable concrete including geopolymer concrete are tested for their efficacy for construction in laboratories. However, the performance and longevity of sustainable concrete for civil engineering applications in corrosive environments are still debatable. This paper aims to investigate the performance of the reinforced geopolymer (GPC) and foam concretes (FC) against corrosive chloride exposure. Two long term key parameters, i.e., corrosion rate and mechanical performance of reinforcing steel in geopolymer and foam concrete were assessed to evaluate their performance against chloride attack. For experiments, reinforced GPC and FC specimens, each admixed with 3 and 5% chlorides, were kept at varying temperatures and humidity levels in the environmental chambers. The corrosion rates of the reinforced geopolymer and foam concrete specimens were also compared with control specimens after 803 days and the tensile strength of the corroded reinforcing steel was also determined. Moreover, the long term efficacy of repaired patches (810 days), in a chloride-rich surrounding environment utilizing FC and GPC, was investigated. The results suggested greater performance of FC compared to GPC under standard environmental conditions. However, the simulated patch repair with GPC showed better resistance against chloride attack compared to FC. The research also undertook the fractographical examination of the surfaces of the reinforcement exposed to 5% admixed chloride and develops models for the corrosion rates of foam concrete as a function of the corrosion rates of geopolymer concrete and chloride content. A correlation model for the corrosion rates of FC and GPC was also developed. The findings of the current research and the model developed are novel and contribute to the knowledge of long term degradation science of geopolymers and form concrete materials. Furthermore, the findings and methodology of the current research have practical significance in the construction and repair industry for determining the remaining service life for any reinforced and steel infrastructure.", "authors": "[\"M.

However, there is a lack of studies on the durability of concrete produced with recycled aggregates from CDW. This study analyzed the influence of incorporating recycled aggregates from CDW, sand, and gravel on the durability parameters of SCC mixtures, with and without the addition of metakaolin (MK), when subjected to two exposure conditions: outdoors and in cycles of attack by chloride ions. Five mixtures were produced: reference SCC, with natural sand and gravel; SCC with recycled sand and gravel; SCC with recycled sand and gravel and the addition of 10% MK; SAC with recycled sand, natural gravel, and the addition of 10% MK; and SCC with natural sand, recycled gravel and the addition of 10% MK. The water/binder ratio was kept constant for all mixtures and the additive dosage was adjusted according to the variation in the use of aggregates. The mechanical and durability properties were assessed using axial compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, chloride penetration, chloride ion diffusion, and electrical resistivity tests. The results showed the feasibility of using recycled aggregates from CDW in SCC. The addition of MK significantly improved the performance of SCC using these aggregates. The mixtures with added MK showed a low risk of corrosion and high resistance to chloride ion penetration, and, under highly aggressive attack conditions, it was observed that the chloride ions did not exceed the minimum cover thickness recommended for reinforced concrete structures. The addition of MK to the mix with recycled aggregates caused an 84.6% reduction in the Cl− diffusion coefficient, there was also a 40.3% reduction in Cl− penetration and an increase of up to 156.14% in electrical resistivity compared to the mix with recycled aggregates without the addition of MK. The SCC mix with recycled sand and metakaolin stood out positively compared to the others, achieving an axial compressive strength similar to the reference mix (55.10 MPa).

Indeed, the maintenance of existing corroded structures and infrastructure is a strategic emerging topic for society. Maintenance strategy deals with the reduction of economic losses, fatalities and injuries caused by the aging of structural and non-structural reinforced concrete (RC) and prestressed concrete (PC) members exposed to natural, accidental and man-made hazards. Maintenance optimization leads to solutions which mitigate the risk of structures subjected to climate changes by adopting efficient and sustainable interventions. Capacity assessment for existing and deteriorating structures is considered in general terms in the main international codes (ISO, ACI318), but detailed normative indications on how to carry out the task are not yet available. A buoyant research effort is being carried out nevertheless to fill this gap. In this context the Special Theme faces the issues related to the capacity assessment of corroded structures so as to provide procedures during in-situ inspections, laboratory tests, monitoring, material modelling, structural idealisation -, able to provide reliable prediction of the structural behaviour of corroded members. The special theme collects papers stemming from topics presented in the third edition of the workshop CACRCS (2021) on Capacity Assessment of Corroded Reinforced Concrete Structures. The on-line CACRCS DAYS 2021 Workshop, was coorganized by CTE – Collegio Tecnici dell'Industrailizzazione Edilizia and fib – International Federation for Structural Concrete, with the support of AICAP – Associazione Italiana Calcestruzzo Armato e Precompresso, fib Italy Young Members Group, AIM Associazione Italiana di Metallurgia, Reluis Consorzio della Rete dei Laboratori Universitari di Ingegneria Sismica e Strutturale, Università degli Studi di Parma and Politecnico di Milano. Thanks to CACRCS DAYS workshops a community of researchers and technicians, experts on the capacity assessment of corroded structures has now been consolidated. The CACRCS DAYS 2021 workshop was dedicated to experimental and numerical procedures for transfer of knowledge from research to daily engineering evaluation. The Proceedings of the CACRCS DAYS 2021 Workshop collect the presented 57 extended abstracts and key-note lectures. This special theme collects relevant contributions related to the assessment of corroded reinforced concrete (RC) and prestressed concrete (PC) structures. A considerable part of the scope covered is concerned with bridge structures. The special theme presents results about the corrosion phenomena, the definition of the corrosion morphology and the damage geometry and constitutive relations between different types of corroded reinforcement. The deterioration phenomena and structural concerns of bridges are investigated together with models for material response, member resistance, and connection behaviour. Other types of structures such as frames and earth retaining walls are covered as well. Design solutions to avoid long-term durability problems with new materials are shown. The contents here presented move from materials to members and to structural behaviour. Bolzoni describes the milestones in the evolution of the study of corrosion of reinforcement in concrete. Russo et al. study corrosion for carbon and stainless steels. A framework for the constitutive behaviour of corroded reinforcement is proposed by Andrade et al. The stress/strain relation for corroding prestressing strand is presented by Franceschini et al., considering pit depth measurements and the maximum pit depth. Cladera et al. use the extension of the Compressive Chord Capacity Model for B-zones of corroding ordinary RC beams, to study the time evolution of chloride corrosion. The models are verified against a wide database of laboratory tests. For prestressed bridge beams Coronelli et al. propose models for flexure and shear resistance, considering the impact of strand corrosion and breakage, with the ensuing prestressing losses. The models are verified with load-testing results of naturally corroded prestressed beams. Njeem et al. introduce the effects of blast actions on corroded beams.

When it is ground, its characteristics are modified. Therefore, the assessment of its long-term durability must be realized in depth. In this sense, an accelerated chloride ingress test has been performed on reinforced mortars made of Portland cement with different amounts of coal bottom ash (CBA) and/or coal fly ash (CFA). Corrosion potential and corrosion rate were continuously monitored. Cement replacement with bottom and fly ash had beneficial long-term effects regarding chloride penetration resistance. Concerning corrosion performance, by far the most dominant influencing parameter was the ash content. Chloride diffusion coefficient in natural test conditions decreased from 23 × 10−12 m2/s in cements without coal ashes to 4.5 × 10−12 m2/s in cements with 35% by weight of coal ashes. Moreover, the time to steel corrosion initiation went from 102 h to about 500 h, respectively. Therefore, this work presents experimental evidence that confirms the positive effect of both types of coal ashes (CBA and CFA) with regard to the concrete steel corrosion.", "authors": "[\"E.

The durability of concrete is challenged due to its porous nature, which is especially important in harsh exposure conditions such as marine environment. The reinforced concrete elements of marine structures such as bridges, wharves, docks, etc. are subjected to various types of exposures such as wetting and drying action [WDA], fully submerged condition, and in contact with chlorides. To refine the pore structure of concrete and to improve the durability characteristics of such structures, it is essential to use high performance concrete [HPC]. In this study, metakaolin [MK] is used as partial replacement of cement to produce HPC. The use of metakaolin is found to be very effective in reducing the porosity of concrete. As the porosity of concrete decreases, the corrosion rate can be reduced considerably. The durability characteristics of metakaolin-incorporated HPC is studied for 365 days to investigate the changes in its pore structure in long term. The iCOR® NDT method is used to find the corrosion performance and concrete resistivity of high performance metakaolin concrete under a simulated wetting and drying action [WDA] of seawater over several periods. The deterioration effect caused by the simulated WDA of seawater is also studied by considering the bond strength of specimens subjected to normal and corrosive exposure conditions.", "authors": "[\"Nivin Philip\", \"Agnieszka J\\u0119drzejewska\", \"A.

However, in the long run, micro-cracking and chloride ion diffusion caused by the corrosion of steel reinforcement exert a hazardous effect on the properties of concretes, which has aroused special attention of the scholars. In this work, the failure mechanism of concrete induced by chlorine-containing sulfate corrosion is studied via array electrode technology, electrochemical experiments, and corrosion morphology analysis. The results show that the failure caused by the corrosive medium diffusion in the cracks inside the concrete can be divided into two stages. First, the corrosive medium reaches the concrete - reinforcement surface and forms a corrosion galvanic cell with a large cathode and a small anode, which promotes the corrosion product accumulation. Second, the Cl - ions destroy the corrosion product layer and make the rust spread to the inside of concrete, while leading to severe pitting corrosion of the metal matrix.", "authors": "[\"Jian-ming Pang\"]", "venue": "International Journal of Electrochemical Science", "year": 2021, "date": null, "relevance_score": 1.0, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": null, "file_size": null, "source": "semantic_scholar", "oa_status": "publisher", "topic": null, "full_content": null}

In this study, the waste oyster shell (WOS) was used as raw materials to prepare the recycled aggregate porous concrete (RAPC), the compressive strength, split tensile strength, chloride penetration resistance, freezing-thawing resistance, low temperature resistance, and the biological attachment were tested, aiming to improve the biological attachment and decrease carbon dioxide emission. The experiment results demonstrate that the use of WOS can decrease the compressive and split tensile strength, but the effect of designed porous structure on the mechanical strength is higher than that of WOS. To ensure the durability of RAPC, the contents of WOS should not exceed 20%. Additionally, the addition of WOS and designed porous structure are beneficial to biological attachment. However, the porous structure of RAPC only improves biological attachment in the short term, and the reverse phenomenon is true in the long term.

The test specimen (B1CL) used for chloride measurement, was a three-meter long reinforced beam kept in a loading state, in a confined salt fog (35 g/l of NaCl) for fourteen years. Because of corrosion of reinforcement, the characterization of mechanical loading was made on another old beam (B1T) cast at the same time but stored in a non-aggressive environment. The measurement of tensile concrete strains using strain gauges showed two parts in the bottom of the beam: the first one is characterized by an elastic behavior and the second one by non-elastic one which is still controlled by the steel reinforcement. Total chloride profiles in relation to the depth were measured in different locations of the tensile zone of reinforced beam B1CL. Until 15 mm depth, the chloride content is constant and corresponds to the maximum chloride content available, taking into account both concrete porosity (where free chloride content corresponds to 35 g/l of NaCl) and concrete binding capacity. Beyond 15 mm depth, total chloride profiles appear to be pure diffusion profiles allowing to calculate the effective diffusion coefficient by using a saturated model of chloride motion taking into account the non-linear binding capacity of concrete. The evolution of effective diffusion coefficient in the beam field (B1CL) is strongly correlated with the field of non-elastic strains in concrete (B1T) and can increase up to 40% in the part of the beam where the non-elastic damage is the more important.", "authors": "[\"A.

The durability degradation of structural concrete located in aggressive marine environments due to corrosion is a major problem in the construction industry. Deterioration due to corrosion is associated with quantifiable losses, which is a financial burden for any developed country. The initiation of corrosion can be obviated to some extent by different methods. Hydrophobic coatings are waterproofing coatings on the external surfaces of concrete structures, which are used to combat the problem of deterioration due to corrosion and to extend the serviceability of reinforced concrete structures. Polyurethane coatings can be used to protect structural materials, particularly those exposed to corrosion, abrasion, weathering, and other processes that would help to degrade base materials over time. From the experimental study conducted, a total of 58 specimens of different descriptions were cast and subjected to several tests, including chloride permeability, chemical resistance, chloride diffusion, water absorption, and corrosion-accelerated procedures using the galvanostatic method. The results indicate that the effectiveness of polyurethane in resisting the diffusion of chloride is eight times greater than that of the base concrete specimen. It has a lower percentage weight reduction, considering acid penetration. The chloride permeability of the coated specimens was negligible, and the water absorption was low. The crack frequency was reduced in the specimens with hydrophobic coatings. The group of specimens with hydrophobic coatings had lower corrosion rates and narrower crack openings and had less reduction in diameter. Furthermore, it takes longer for cracks to develop on the surface of the specimen with polyurethane coatings. It has a lower amount of corrosion, and it takes a longer period to accumulate a critical amount of corrosion. Thus, hydrophobic polyurethane coatings are highly effective in reducing the chloride permeability and water penetration values, which helps to eliminate corrosion and lengthen the service life of structures located in an aggressive marine environment.", "authors": "[\"Cecielle N.

And the steel corrosion caused by chloride ion erosion is the most serious damage to reinforced concrete structures, which affects the safety and service life of the structure. In order to prevent steel corrosion caused by chloride, it is necessary to pay more attention to chloride ion penetration damage. At present, the most commonly used method is to use additives in concrete structures, so as to improve the durability of concrete by reducing its permeability coefficient. Cement-based permeable crystalline admixtures can effectively improve the impermeability and mechanical properties of concrete by complex crystallization reactions between reactive chemicals and cement gels. In the paper, the Penetron admix 803 was selected as a typical CPCA in the experimental study, and the rapid chloride migration (RCM) experiments and mechanics experiments were carried out for four concrete structures with different dosages of Penetron admix 803 (PA8). Compared with plain concrete, the concrete structure containing PA8 makes it difficult for water and other liquids to enter by filling micropores and shrinkage cracks by scanning electron microscope test, so its impermeability is greatly improved. And concrete structure containing permeable crystalline admixture can reduce chloride ion permeability effectively. The experimental results showed that with the increase of PA8 content, the diffusion coefficient of the concrete structure decreased rapidly from 45.8 × 10−12 m2/s to 17.7 × 10−12 m2/s, while the service life of concrete structures increased continuously. And the mechanism of the chemical reaction between PA8 and the internal components of concrete structure was revealed, which was mainly due to the catalytic reaction between the reactive chemicals of PA8 and the cement hydrates of concrete structure forming insoluble crystals filled with concrete micropores. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that the permeable crystalline admixture can greatly improve the chloride-related durability and mechanical properties of the concrete structure.", "authors": "[\"Yu-chuan Yang\", \"Hai-bo Li\", \"Xing-guo Yang\", \"Shi-quan Chen\", \"Jia\\u2010wen Zhou\"]", "venue": "Advance in Civil Engineering", "year": 2022, "date": null, "relevance_score": 1.0, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": "cc-by", "file_size": null, "source": "semantic_scholar", "oa_status": "publisher", "topic": null, "full_content": null}

This research is a continuation of previous studies in which authors observed corrosion in the repaired corroded patches of ordinary concrete (OC) in the form of macro-cell. In the current this phenomenon is investigated in lightweight concrete (LWC) and compared with self-compacting concrete (SSC) by long term experiments. It is reviewed that for modern construction, LWC is gaining attention among civil engineers for ordinary and offshore structures construction due to its lightweight and workability over OC. However, the question whether the corrosion behavior in the normal and repaired patches of LWC is the same like other types of concrete is still remained to be answered. This paper addresses this question and evaluates the performance of the corroded repair patches of LWC structure in highly corrosive environments. Test specimens were prepared with LWC closely simulating field conditions in such a way that their two ends were contaminated with 5% and 3% chloride respectively and the middle portion (simulated repaired patch) was cast after one day with LWC having no chloride in it. After 180 days of electrochemical and physical corrosion measurements of specimens, re-corrosion phenomenon in the repaired patches was observed. This research has practical application and it can be used for developing models for the predictions of service and remaining service of LWC structures in corrosive environments.", "authors": "[\"M.

This paper aims to investigate the long-term performance of reinforced concrete (RC) beams with corroded reinforcement numerically. Two experimental datasets from existing literature were selected to build a nonlinear finite element model. The selected beams were tested under four-points sustained bending load and three bending point flexural test with deferent level of corrosion. A parametric study was then conducted taking into account concrete compressive strength, reinforcement yield strength, ambient temperature, relative humidity and sustained load level to get a better understanding on the factors that effecting the long-term behaviour of concrete beams with corroded reinforcement. Results demonstrated that, Diana FEA has an excellent ability to predicating the long-term behaviour of RC beams with corroded reinforcement. The analysis of the parametric study revealed that increasing relative humidity from 70% to 90% resulted in a 45% to 53% reduction in developed deflections. Whereas once the temperature rose from 20°C to 40°C the developed deflection increased from 13.9% to 17.2%. This outcome demonstrating the significant impact of environmental factors on the long-term behaviour of corroded reinforced concrete beams.

One of the most cost-effective ways to lessen chloride-induced corrosion was identified to be the use of more supplementary cementitious material (SCM). Moreover, when SCMs are ground down to a smaller size, the resulting particles serve as microfillers, which have a significant impact on the improvement of mechanical properties and durability. This paper highlights the influence of grinding slag into an Ultra Fine Slag (UFS) on chloride ion penetration in the mortar specimen.

This work experimentally investigated the corrosion process involving various concentrations of NaCl-Na2SO4 leading to the coupled erosion of concrete. The appearance, weight, and mechanical properties of the concrete were measured throughout the erosion process, and the Cl− and SO42− contents in concrete were determined using Cl− rapid testing and spectrophotometry, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy, energy spectrometry, X-ray diffractometry, and mercury porosimetry were also employed to analyze microstructural changes and complex mineral combinations in these samples. The results showed that with higher Na2SO4 concentration and longer exposure time, the mass, compressive strength, and relative dynamic elastic modulus gradually increased and large pores gradually transitioned to medium and small pores. When the Na2SO4 mass fraction in the salt solution was ≥10 wt%, there was a downward trend in the mechanical properties after exposure for a certain period of time. The Cl− diffusion rate was thus related to Na2SO4 concentration. When the Na2SO4 mass fraction in solution was ≤5 wt% and exposure time short, SO42− and cement hydration/corrosion products hindered Cl− migration. In a concentrated Na2SO4 environment (≥10 wt%), the Cl− diffusion rate was accelerated in the later stages of exposure. These experiments further revealed that the Cl− migration rate was higher than that of SO42−.", "authors": "[\"Fei Zhang\", \"Zhiping Hu\", \"Feng juan Wei\", \"Xin Wen\", \"Xiaoguang Li\", \"L.

In this work, concrete columns with carbon and stainless steel reinforcements were exposed to a real marine environment. In order to monitor the corrosion processes, two types of corrosion probes were embedded in these columns at different height levels. The results from the monitoring of the probes were compared to the actual corrosion damage in the different exposure zones. Electrical resistance (ER) probes and coupled multi-electrodes (CMEs) were shown to be promising methods for long-term corrosion monitoring in concrete. Correlations between the different exposure zones and the corrosion processes of the steel in the concrete were found. Macrocell corrosion properties and the distribution of the separated anodic/cathodic places on the steel in chloride-contaminated concrete were addressed as two of the key issues for understanding the corrosion mechanisms in such environments. The specific advantages and limitations of the tested measuring techniques for long-term corrosion monitoring were also indicated. The results of the measurements and the corrosion damage evaluation clearly confirmed that the tested stainless steels (AISI 304 and AISI 304L) in a chloride-contaminated environment behave significantly better than ordinary carbon steel, with corrosion rates from 110× to 9500× lower in the most severe (tidal) exposure conditions.", "authors": "[\"N.

The mechanical properties and durability of self-compacting concrete with different admixtures were investigated and the results indicated that the concrete workability is best when FB and PS were 15%, respectively. While early mechanical properties were not as good as the control samples, but long-term strength exceeded the control from extending over curing time. Chloride ion permeation test proved that the sample of self-compacting concrete with 15% FB had the lowest electrical flux for the value for 1690 Coulombs and the minimum diffusion coefficient for 5.30 × 10−8 m2/s. The effect of improvement to PS on mechanical properties and electric flux was not as good as that of FB. Meanwhile, XRD, TGA-DTG, and SEM tests were performed on the samples for curing 7 days and 28 days. XRD test showed a 28-day peak of Calcium Hydroxide has a dramatic drop for CFB-15%. TGA-DTG test showed that the 28-day hydration degree of CFB-15% was 64.08%, which was much higher than that of the control group and CPS-15%. SEM test proved the spectacular filling property and pozzolanic effect of FB varied the interfacial adhesion of the cement particles. Mercury intrusion experiments indicated the amount of internal pore decreased with the addition of FB and PF.", "authors": "[\"Deliang He\", \"Shi Yu\", \"Tianlu Luo\", \"Wu Tao\", \"Xiaodong Luo\", \"Jinhua Zhu\"]", "venue": "Journal of Adhesion Science and Technology", "year": 2020, "date": null, "relevance_score": 0.9517704608280648, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": null, "file_size": null, "source": "semantic_scholar", "oa_status": "open", "topic": null, "full_content": null}

The objective of this study was to explore the potential enhancements in concrete performance through fiber reinforcement, considering the two distinct fiber types - steel and nylon. A comprehensive testing program was devised, encompassing a wide range of fiber combinations to assess their individual and combined effects on concrete properties. The concrete specimens were prepared by incorporating different sizes (length and diameter) and proportions (percentage by volume) of steel and nylon fibers into the concrete mix. Mechanical properties, including compressive strength, tensile strength, and flexural strength, were evaluated to determine the impact of fiber reinforcement on the concrete's load-bearing capacity and resistance to cracking. Additionally, the durability properties, chloride ion penetration, and abrasion resistance, were assessed to understand the potential improvement in the concrete's long-term performance under adverse environmental conditions. The experimental results revealed significant variations in the mechanical and durability properties of the fiber-reinforced concrete compared to the conventional concrete mix. Steel fibers demonstrated superior performance in enhancing the concrete's load-carrying capacity and ductility, especially at higher percentages. On the other hand, nylon fibers exhibited exceptional resistance to and abrasion, contributing to improved durability. Notably, the steel and nylon fibers exhibited synergistic effects, leading to a balanced enhancement of mechanical and durability properties. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the benefits of incorporating steel and nylon fibers in concrete, offering an effective means of optimizing the material's overall performance for diverse engineering applications. The results from this research can serve as a basis for developing more resilient and sustainable concrete structures, which can withstand harsh environmental conditions and contribute to the advancement of construction practices. Further exploration into the long-term behavior and cost-effectiveness of fiber-reinforced concrete is recommended for a comprehensive understanding of its feasibility in practical engineering applications.", "authors": "[\"Muhammad Adnan\", \"Aqeel Ahmed\", \"Zaheer Ahmed\", \"Naveed Anjum\", \"Munaza Komal\", \"Khalid Hussain\"]", "venue": "Construction Technologies and Architecture", "year": 2024, "date": null, "relevance_score": 0.9179975107131928, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": "cc-by", "file_size": null, "source": "semantic_scholar", "oa_status": "publisher", "topic": null, "full_content": null}

However, experimental issues such as inadequate bar end isolation, ponding bath leakage, and inappropriate specimen design and testing methodology can result in data that misrepresents long-term service performance. Further, the fact that most testing protocols employ cyclic chloride solution ponding can lead to erroneous ranking of different corrosion resistant reinforcements and false projection of service performance, specifically because surface chloride concentration becomes elevated compared to that for actual service.

Combined with the RCM test and bridge service data, a quantitative design method for bridge concrete durability is proposed. Test results show that the growth rate of the chloride ion diffusion coefficient of concrete is approximately 1.028 for every 1 °C increase. For every 5 °C increase, the growth rate of the chloride diffusion coefficient of concrete is about 1.15, and the cover depth of the concrete structure should be multiplied by a coefficient of 1.07. Therefore, the concrete cover depth should be appropriately increased, considering the influence of ambient temperature. Furthermore, fly ash, slag, and stone powder can increase the concrete’s resistance to chloride corrosion.

Transport of chlorides in concrete due to capillary suction during drying and wetting cycles as well as diffusion in combination with carbonation tends to result in corrosion of the rebar and loss of structural integrity. This damage mechanism mainly applies to directly weathered components. After a longer service life, however, components that are not directly exposed, such as concrete surfaces outside the spraying water area of a tunnel, are also affected. A long-term study over 12 years was performed to investigate the effect of hydrophobic treatment on the moisture balance and durability of a suspended tunnel ceiling compared to an untreated surface with the same exposure. Embedded sensors installed in the concrete structure and an online monitoring system were used to measure the electrical resistivity of the concrete and the corrosion rate of the steel reinforcement over time. Furthermore, the data obtained were combined with climate measurements in the tunnel to gain new insights on the effect of tunnel climate on the damage mechanism. The measurements allowed to prove the long-term effect and correct application of hydrophobic treatment. With these results it is possible to make a more precise estimation of the condition and the deterioration process of the tunnel ceiling and to optimize the rehabilitation schedule.", "authors": "[\"M.

The corrosion condition of steel reinforcement in reinforced concrete structures and products is the main factor determining their bearing capacity and durability. The alkalinity of the pore liquid of concrete (at pH &gt; 11.8) in reinforced concrete structures and products under normal conditions ensures the passive state of steel reinforcement. In the presence or when chloride, sulfate and other analogous ions enter the concrete, the steel reinforcement of reinforced concrete structures and products depassives, despite the pH value &gt; 11.8, and begins to corrode. In addition, depassivation and subsequent corrosion of steel reinforcement occur during carbonation (neutralization) of the protective layer of concrete due to a decrease in pH &lt; 11.8. One of the promising options for slowing down or stopping the corrosion processes of steel reinforcement is currently the use of migrating corrosion inhibitors.&#x0D; &#x0D; The aim of the work was to obtain experimental data on the ability of migrating steel corrosion inhibitors to inhibit or completely stop the corrosion of reinforcement in reinforced concrete structures and products initiated by the presence of chloride ions (Cl-) in concrete or neutralization of the protective layer of concrete in relation to steel reinforcement.&#x0D; &#x0D; Materials and methods.

A predictive model has been developed to describe anode current output over time. The predictive model which includes an “aging-factor” can be determined for any galvanic anode. The aging-factor is primarily dependent on the activating chemistry of the anode. The aging-factor also depends on the relative surface area of the anode compared to the surface area of steel wherein the harder an anode works early on in its life the worse its aging-factor becomes. The predictive model which is based on long-term field data allows galvanic anode systems to be designed to meet any desired performance criteria at any point in time.

As indicated in the first part of the article published in the Industrial and Civil Engineering journal (No. 12, 2023), the relevance of the work is due to the increased volume of use of longitudinal reinforcement couplings in reinforced concrete structures. The analysis of the domestic and foreign regulatory and technical base has shown that there is an opportunity to optimize coupling connections in terms of arrangement of their spacing. In that work, prototypes were described for conducting experimental studies to assess the effect of various design solutions for the spacing of coupling joints of stretched reinforcement on the strength of normal sections of bent elements. This article analyzes the experimental strength data obtained and offers appropriate recommendations for the design of bent reinforced concrete structures with coupling joints. Aim. Improvement of the urban planning system in terms of clarifying and supplementing of existing regulatory documents on the design of reinforced concrete structures. Materials and methods. The research was carried out taking into account modern requirements, as well as the analysis of the results of their own experiments. Results. The result of the work is an analysis of the experimental data obtained for bent reinforced concrete beams with coupling joints of stretched reinforcement. Based on the analysis, recommendations have been formed to optimize design solutions and clarify the requirements for the input control of couplings. Conclusions. Considering that, in general, according to the results of the work, a fairly good convergence of experimental and theoretical results has been obtained, it is possible to assume a reduced value of coupling spacing for certain types of load-bearing reinforced concrete structures. The need to tighten the input control of couplings in order to detect defects has also been identified. In addition, the need for further research on this issue was noted.", "authors": "[\"Sergey A.

The difference in test methods must be considered and the transfer parameter kt should be introduced into the service life prediction model when the test results of accelerated methods are used. According to the test data of coastal exposure in South China, the attenuation rule of the chloride diffusion coefficient of different cement-based materials changed with time and was analyzed in this paper.

The vast majority of reinforced concrete bridges built in Ukraine until the 1950s were mostly monolithic. Spans were built of monolithic concrete with a length of 2, ..., 6 m and ribbed structures with a length of 8, ..., 15 m. Monolithic spans were provided with good spatial work and considerable durability. Problems Statement. The main disadvantage of reinforced concrete monolithic spans of bridges built before the 50s of the last century was the low design strength of concrete, which over time led to defects and thus reduce their durability. In addition, the vast majority of such bridges with monolithic spans were built according to technical standards of 1962 and earlier, and at this time the load capacity does not meet the requirements of modern regulations. The need to study the stress-strain state, to determine the bearing capacity of the spans of bridges after long-term operation, given the above, is an important factor in deciding on the feasibility of their repair. Purpose. Research of the stress-strain state of the structures of the monolithic spans of the bridge after its long operation. Materials and Methods. A survey of the monolithic reinforced concrete span of the bridge, built in 1940, was carried out. It was established that the span of the bridge, in accordance with the identified defects, is in a limited working condition (condition 4). And given the low load capacity of the span, condition 5 (inoperable) was finally adopted. The main defects found during the inspections of the span significantly reduce its durability and bearing capacity. Destruction of the protective layer of beams of the span with exposure and intensive corrosion of reinforcement with weakening of the area by more than 10% was revealed. Based on the data from the inspection of the bridge, it was decided to conduct additional tests to determine the stress-strain state of the spans, the availability of strength reserves and the possibility of strengthening them or the need for replacement. Results. Based on the test of the bridge, the parameters of spatial work and stress-strain state of the span were determined by measuring the absolute deformations (deflections) under the action of static load. According to the test results, the value of the design coefficient k, which is in the range of 0.1… 0.79, was determined. The values of the transverse distribution coefficients (CRC) for each beam were experimentally determined and the numerical analysis of the field and analytical spatial work of the span of the bridge on the transverse distribution coefficients was performed. Conclusion. The results of the analysis of experimentally and analytically obtained test data of the bridge indicate the normal spatial operation of the bridge spans, which corresponds to the nature of the idealized finite element scheme, good spatial rigidity and the presence of strength reserves in the bridge spans.

However, these structures are highly susceptible to chloride-induced corrosion, compromising their durability. Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) offers superior durability, but faces adoption barriers due to rigid design requirements and high costs, largely driven by steel fiber reinforcement. Recent advances in fiber technology and the development of greener cementitious materials created opportunities for alternative, sustainable, and cost-effective UHPC designs that could significantly enhance coastal infrastructure resilience, particularly as climate change intensifies natural hazards. However, data on the mechanical and long-term performance of such UHPC in harsh environments remain limited. This study investigates the durability and damage resistance of sustainable UHPC mixtures based on Portland limestone cement (PLC), incorporating high volumes of fly ash and slag, and reinforced with steel and polyethylene fibers. Specimens were exposed to seawater for up to 550 days and compared to a commercial UHPC. Evaluations included mass variation, electrical resistivity, ultrasonic pulse velocity, compressive strength, water sorption, thermogravimetric analysis, and resistance to chloride ingress and carbonation. Results indicate that the laboratory-developed UHPC mixtures, whether damaged or undamaged, exhibited excellent resistance to marine exposure, showing limited degradation, and performing comparably to the commercial UHPC.

There is a consensus among engineers that demand will increase due to ageing infrastructure stock, climate change, and the option to reuse structures which is a logical solution to help reduce carbon emissions. New manufacturers will likely emerge to meet the needs of a growing market. However, there is no standard for galvanic anodes for use in concrete. In theory, products may come to market that fails to work as anodes, and hence corrosion may not be arrested, and repeated intervention could be required. This paper presents a methodology that has been developed for demonstrating anodes function as intended in a short-term test. Anodes were cast into concrete, and drive voltage, resistivity, and resultant current were measured when connected to an external cathode. The test setup was applied to several commercially available galvanic anodes. All anodes achieved a current output of 0.35 mA in this experimental setup. This could provide a rapid test to screen anodes new to the market. The analyses show inherent anode behaviour varied with different manufacturers, and there were also performance differences among replicate anodes. Such behavioural characteristics may affect the long-term performance of the anodes. These results provide new data on galvanic anodes and demonstrate the potential need for standardisation in the industry.", "authors": "[\"R. Cobbs\", \"R. Brueckner\", \"C.

Harmful ions and gases can accelerate steel corrosion. Permeability-reducing admixtures (PRA), including crystalline admixtures (CA), are commonly used to mitigate this.

Two concrete mixtures with matching proportions were prepared: a reference mix and another mix with a commercial crystalline admixture. Several properties were studied, such as compressive strength, density, porosity, electrical resistivity, water absorption capacity, chloride diffusion, air permeability, and corrosion resistance. The studied admixture in concrete yields several positive outcomes such as a slight reduction in mixing water, a potential 6% increase in concrete’s compressive strength and the development of a denser and less permeable structure with 3% lower porosity and water absorption than the reference mix. Electrical resistivity improves by 10%. Unidirectional chloride diffusion tests show no differences. Air permeability decreases by from 36% to 55%, and the water absorption rate diminishes by 23%.

These indices were compared to determine correlation coefficients that are the most important for obtaining better corrosion initiation forecasting.

Such a case is described for an 80-year-old RC structure observed annually over about 30 years in what is essentially an extraordinary long experiment. Despite very high chloride concentrations, field excavation evidence showed that reinforcement corrosion overall remains minimal, except where insufficient concrete compaction permitted air-voids to initiate quite severe, very localized corrosion even with still high concrete pH. It is possible that the use of blast furnace slag as aggregate may have assisted the observed durability. The case study supports other studies that show that it is possible to achieve long-term durable and therefore sustainable RC structures without additives and using only conventional reinforcement steels and conventional cements and aggregates.

Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcing bars made with a thermosetting matrix offer corrosion resistance but cannot be field-bent, which limits flexibility during construction. FRP reinforcing bars made with fiber-reinforced thermoplastic polymers (FRTP) address this limitation; however, their high processing viscosity presents manufacturing challenges. In this study, the Continuous Forming Machine, a novel pultrusion device that uses pre-consolidated fiber-reinforced thermoplastic tapes as feedstock, is described and used to fabricate 12.7 mm nominal diameter thermoplastic composite rebars. Simple bend tests on FRTP rebar that rely on basic equipment are performed to verify its ability to be field-formed. The manual bending technique demonstrated here is practical and straightforward, although it does result in some fiber misalignment. Subsequently, surface deformations are introduced to the rebar to promote mechanical bonding with concrete, and tensile tests of the bars are conducted to determine their mechanical properties. Finally, flexural tests of simply-supported, 6 m long beams reinforced with FRTP rebar are performed to assess their strength and stiffness as well as the practicality of using FRTP rebar. The beam tests demonstrated the prototype FRTP rebar’s potential for reinforcing concrete beams, and the beam load–deformation response and capacity agree well with predictions developed using conventional structural analysis principles. Overall, the results of the research reported indicate that thermoplastic rebars manufactured via the Continuous Forming Machine are a promising alternative to both steel and conventional thermoset composite rebar.

In the case of South Korea, according to data from the Ministry of Environment, it is predicted that the depletion of aggregate resources will occur in 20 years, considering the amount of aggregate used in construction every year and the amount of natural aggregate. Therefore, it is necessary to develop recycled aggregates that can replace natural aggregates for construction. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the applicability of recyclable air-cooled slag (ACS) aggregates as a substitute material for natural aggregates applied to rural-road pavement concrete. That is, the applicability of rural-road pavement concrete is evaluated by evaluating the strength and durability of rural-road pavement concrete to which an ACS aggregate is applied. Durability was assessed in terms of the chloride ion diffusion, repeated wetting-drying, abrasion resistance, impact resistance, and repeated freezing-thawing tests. The test result showed that the diffusion coefficient of the mixture to which the ACS aggregate was applied was slightly larger. In addition, the diffusion coefficient was slightly larger in the case of applying the air-cooled slag coarse aggregate (GG) than in the case of applying the air-cooled slag fine aggregate (GS). The results of abrasion and impact resistance tests of ACS-aggregate-incorporated rural-road concrete indicated that abrasion and impact resistance decreased as the aggregate content increased. The ACS retained some of the properties of the blast furnace slag. Thus, in repetitive wetting-drying tests, which can cause changes in chemical properties, the ACS aggregate increased the concrete’s long-term residual strength. In addition, the results showed that the relative dynamic elastic modulus targeting repeated freezing-thawing resistance satisfied the 80% target. The freeze-thaw resistance improved as the ACS aggregate content increased. In conclusion, the results of this study showed that the durability of rural-road pavement concrete can be improved experimentally by applying both GG and GS at the same time. Therefore, it is shown that ACS aggregates can be applied to rural-road pavement concrete as a substitute for natural aggregates.", "authors": "[\"Byung-Hwan Ahn\", \"Su-Jin Lee\", \"Chan-Gi Park\"]", "venue": "Applied Sciences", "year": 2021, "date": null, "relevance_score": 0.7, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": "cc-by", "file_size": null, "source": "semantic_scholar", "oa_status": "publisher", "topic": null, "full_content": null}

This makes it vulnerable to structural damage. One of the most serious threats to the durability  of its concrete and reinforced concrete structures is electrocorrosion. This phenomenon is caused by \"stray currents\" and high  voltage, which arise from incomplete insulation between the rails and the ground. These currents intensify the migration of  chloride ions and Ca2+ cations, accelerating rebar corrosion and concrete degradation. \nThe article systematically analyzes and summarizes current understandings of electrocorrosion, identifying key destruction  mechanisms, influencing factors, and protection methods. It also outlines critical research gaps and practical implications for  enhancing railway infrastructure durability. Studying the durability of concrete and reinforced concrete is critically important  because, while processes like carbonation and chloride penetration are well-researched, electrocorrosion is a distinct and  complex problem. The alkaline environment of concrete usually provides a passive layer on steel rebar, but the penetration of  carbon dioxide and chloride ions destroys this protective layer.Stray currents are divided into direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC). DC stray currents, typical for subways, cause  significant corrosion of buried metal pipelines and accelerate pitting corrosion of steel, even surpassing the effects of fatigue. AC stray currents, common in ACelectrified railways, lead to a reduction in the service life of structures, although they cause  less overall corrosion. The mechanisms of corrosion due to AC stray currents are more complex, including the rectification  model, the alkalization mechanism, and the autocatalytic mechanism.Stray currents significantly alter the physicochemical properties of concrete: they accelerate the diffusion of calcium ions,  increase porosity, and weaken the concrete's ability to bind chloride ions, creating an accelerated corrosion cycle. Experimental studies have shown that an AC voltage of 40 V, in combination with water flow, causes the maximum loss of concrete strength  and intensive dissolution of cement paste minerals.The practical significance of these studies lies in improving the classification of concretes by permeability and developing  protective solutions. These solutions include steel and liquid glass screens with deep grounding, as well as replacing  traditional rail fastenings on sleepers and ballastless bridge deck slabs with resilient fastenings that have increased electrical  resistance.The Ukrainian railway infrastructure faces additional challenges: aging structures, consequences of military actions (damage  to railway tracks and electrical infrastructure, which disrupts grounding and insulation), insufficient quality control of  materials, and the lack of comprehensive monitoring systems.Conclusions emphasize that electrocorrosion is a complex problem requiring a comprehensive approach to monitoring,  diagnostics, and the implementation of modern protection methods.Prospects for further work include developing integrated real-time monitoring systems, in-depth study of the long-term  effects of low AC voltages, creating new corrosion-resistant materials, optimizing existing protection systems, and adapting  advanced computational methods for predicting degradation processes.", "authors": "[\"S.

Strain hardening cementitious composites (SHCC) is a class of advanced cementitious composites with superior ductility and durability. Due to the lack of long‐term test data, the current probability‐based design guidelines may not be applicable to SHCC coating. This paper develops a fuzzy‐stochastic–based approach to assess the durability performance of coatings using cement mortar and engineered cementitious composites (ECC), a specific type of SHCC. The age factor and the mean of chloride diffusion coefficient are modeled as fuzzy variables, and the chloride diffusion coefficient follows Gaussian distribution. Based on limited test data and subjective opinion, membership functions are proposed for the mean of initial chloride diffusion coefficient and the age factor of cement and ECC. To achieve equivalent durability performance of cement mortar coating, the amount of uncracked and cracked ECC coating are estimated to be around 33% and 25%, respectively. Based on equivalent durability performance, life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted to compare the ecological performance of the two coatings. A case study, based on a 25‐m‐long simply supported box girder in Shenzhen Bay, is given to elaborate the proposed approach and the evaluation results of durability performance and ecological impacts.", "authors": "[\"Xue Li\", \"Yutao Huang\", \"Yingwu Zhou\", \"Xiaowei Wang\", \"Debo Zhao\", \"Cheng Chen\"]", "venue": "Comput.

Methodology. To achieve the goal, a review and synthesis of scientific and technical sources and regulatory documents regarding the technical condition of reinforced concrete and steel-reinforced concrete bridges and overpasses of Ukraine is carried out. It is shown that the development and implementation of new technologies for repairing the existing bridge defective structures, in particular on the highways of Ukraine is an urgent problem.

This review provides a systematic and critical synthesis of research on hot-dip galvanized (HDG) reinforcement, integrating electrochemical, structural, and field-based perspectives. The methodology involved comparative evaluation of laboratory studies, long-term monitoring data, and technological advances to identify consensus findings and unresolved controversies. The novelty of this review lies in its focused analysis of three critical debates: the influence of initial hydrogen evolution on interfacial bond strength, the conditional stability of the calcium hydroxyzincate passive layer in high-alkalinity environments, and the discrepancy between accelerated laboratory testing and field performance. The review also compares HDG with alternative reinforcement systems, particularly epoxy-coated and stainless steel rebars, to contextualize durability and cost trade-offs. Recent innovations, including continuous galvanized rebar (CGR), zinc-alloy modifications, non-destructive evaluation methods, and computational service-life modeling, are highlighted as transformative developments.

The benefits of using Ultra-High Performance (Fiber-Reinforced) Concrete—UHP(FR)C to extend the service life of concrete structures in “chloride attack” scenarios have been addressed, mainly focusing on higher “intrinsic” durability of the aforementioned category of materials due to their compact microstructure. Scant, if nil, information exists on the chloride diffusion and penetration resistance of UHPC in the cracked state, which would be of the utmost importance, also considering the peculiar (tensile) behavior of the material and its high inborn autogenous healing capacity. On the other hand, studies aimed at quantifying the delay in chloride penetration promoted by self-healing, both autogenous and autonomous, of cracked (ordinary) concrete have started being promoted, further highlighting the need to investigate the multidirectional features of the phenomenon, in the direction both parallel and orthogonal to cracks. In this paper, a tailored experimental methodology is presented and validated to measure, with reference to its multidirectional features, the chloride penetration in cracked UHPC and the effects on it of self-healing, both autogenous and stimulated via crystalline admixtures. The methodology is based on micro-core drilling in different positions and at different depths of UHPC disks cracked in splitting and submitted to different exposure/healing times in a 33g/L NaCl aqueous solution.

They have been mostly utilized for strengthening purposes, especially as externally bonded reinforcement for columns, slabs, and beams. Their lightweight, flexibility and ease of installation, and higher strength offer an ideal solution for increasing the axial, bending, and shear resistance of existing concrete elements, as well as restoration and retrofitting of damaged members. FRP bars have also been used as internal reinforcement for concrete structural elements, providing corrosion-resistant alternatives to conventional steel reinforcements. Although the application of FRP for concrete members has offered many advantages, there have been issues and concerns associated with their long-term performance including their debonding from a concrete surface or within a concrete element. Accordingly, despite their durability, concrete elements strengthened/reinforced with FRP materials need to be inspected periodically to detect potential issues and hence prevent any premature failures.

Accordingly, this study first introduces damages and anomalies attributed to FRP reinforced/strengthened concrete bridge elements, and causes are discussed.

This was the first prestressed concrete bridge in Japan, and the world, to utilize carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (Carbon Fiber Composite Cable, CFCC) tendons in its main girders to counteract salt damage. To investigate and clarify the serviceability and durability of the main girders after a long period of service in a corrosive environment, two full-scale PC test girders were fabricated and placed next to the main girders in the same conditions at the time of the original construction from 1988. One of them was used for a destructive test in 1994. In this study, another test specimen exposed to a severe environment for 30 years was subjected to a destructive bending test and CFCCs taken out from the test girder were analyzed via mechanical and chemical tests. The suitability of the CFCC and durability of the main girder were confirmed. In addition, a numerical model was proposed to predict the behavior of a main PC girder using a finite element analysis program called DIANA. The influences of the input data from the experiment, the decrease in material properties, and the bond-slip model were studied in the simulation.", "authors": "[\"H. Nguyen\", \"H. Masuya\", \"T.

By developing the reliable mathematical model of chloride penetration into concrete structures, it can help structural engineers and management agencies with predicting the service life of reinforced concrete structures in order to effectively schedule the maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation program. This paper presents a theoretical and computational model for chloride diffusion in concrete structures. The governing equations are taking into account the coupled transport process of chloride ions, moisture, and temperature. This represents the actual condition of concrete structures which are always found in nonsaturated and nonisothermal conditions. The fully coupled effects among chloride, moisture, and heat diffusion are considered and included in the model. The coupling parameters evaluated based on the available material models and test data are proposed and explicitly incorporated in the governing equations. The numerical analysis of coupled transport equations is performed using the finite element method. The model is validated by comparing the numerical results against the available experimental data and a good agreement is observed.", "authors": "[\"Nattapong Damrongwiriyanupap\", \"S.

Cured CSC-based concrete has a lower pore water pH (9-11) than OPC-based concrete (13-14), likely resulting in a corrosion initiation stage that is comparatively shorter. However, CSC-based concrete has a higher resistivity than OPC-based concrete, making the formation of corrosion macrocells more difficult. Corrosion experiments were performed to evaluate the corrosion-related durability of these two formulations. The array of tests included exposure to fresh water and salt water (each alternate wetting and drying regimes) and a high humidity environment. Additionally, accelerated corrosion propagation test were performed to assess the ability of each concrete formulation to accommodate corrosion products as an indicator of the duration of the corrosion propagation stage. The corrosion performance of each concrete formulation was evaluated in terms of chloride diffusivity, corrosion rate, and the critical corrosion penetration required to crack the concrete.

The results of the study of carbonization of concrete on specially prepared model samples of concrete with a size of 250x250x250 mm with an exposure period in NACE solution for 500 days without external load are presented. Measurements of corrosion damage of reinforcing rods, which were placed inside concrete cubes, were performed. The method of estimating the amount of carbonization of concrete and corrosion of reinforcement is described in detail in known scientific papers. The obtained data testify to the active carbonization of concrete during the whole exposure period of the samples in NACE solution, however, concrete prepared at the ratio W/C = 0.5 and 0.6 is particularly significant in terms of carbonization intensity. Concrete with a ratio of W/C = 0.7 is less susceptible to damage. Moreover, a similar trend is observed for corrosion of fittings. This is due to the fact that the increase of the aqueous medium in the concrete mass facilitates diffusion processes of delivery to the reactive zone of chemically aggressive ingredients such as carbon dioxide, chloride ions, hydrogen, sulfur, sulfate ions, various types of bacteria and the like. The kinetics of concrete carbonization and corrosion of reinforcing bars in chemically aggressive NACE medium depending on the exposure period of the samples in the model solution was experimentally studied. It is established that with the increase of the water-cement ratio W/C from 0.5 to 0.7, the depth of carbonization and the layer thickness of corrosion products increase sharply. The flooding of the surface layers of the reinforcement and their strong embrittlement in the process of long-term operation of the reinforcement in the structure of reinforced concrete, which causes a decrease in crack resistance in general of reinforced concrete structures. The degradation of reinforcing steel during long-term operation in aggressive environments, which leads to premature corrosion damage to the reinforcement with subsequent destruction of the structure, was investigated experimentally with the involvement of high-precision metallographic equipment.", "authors": "[\"V.

Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensing technology is extensively developed in photoelectric monitoring technology and has been used on many projects. FBG can detect the quasi-distribution of strain and temperature under corrosive environments, and thus it is suitable for monitoring reinforced concrete cracking. According to the mechanical principle that corrosion expansion is responsible for the reinforced concrete cracking, a package design of reinforced concrete cracking sensors based on FBG was proposed and investigated in this study. The corresponding relationship between the grating wavelength and strain was calibrated by an equal strength beam test. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by an electrically accelerated corrosion experiment.

Political, administrative, and budgetary factors, coupled with climate change, pose tasks to structural integrity, affecting industries and economies. Marine infrastructures represent a strategic asset of a country as they handle a large part of the economic exchanges. This article analyzes five essential factors that play a fundamental role in the performance analysis of coastal structures: chloride-induced corrosion, degradation models, maintenance strategies, monitoring, and climate change. We start with reinforcement corrosion, which is considered as the main cause of distress, particularly in coastal zones, for the long-term behavior of structures. Additional pressure from the influences of climate change is becoming evident and extreme, leading to a reduction in capacity. To guarantee the lifespan of infrastructures, degradation models contribute by estimating the long-term performance of the asset as a strategic piece to the development of effective maintenance solutions. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have gained recent prominence in this field due to their ability to learn intricate patterns from historical data, making them valuable instruments for predicting structural deterioration. Additionally, quantifying the condition of the structure from monitoring data plays a crucial part in providing information on the current situation of the structure. Finally, this review summarizes the challenges associated with the maintenance of aging marine structures considering aspects such as corrosion, monitoring, and the future challenges this area will face due to climate change.", "authors": "[\"Luis F.

Although substantial resources are often allocated for maintenance, developing more efficient systems for monitoring RC structures in corrosive conditions is essential to ensure their long-term durability and safety. This research aims to establish a clear connection between the surrounding corrosion environment and the behaviour of steel bars embedded in concrete, which is vital for maintaining the required service level of RC structures. Sacrificial Anode Metal Sheets (SAMS), integrated with a Micro Energy Harvester (MEH) based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology, are proposed and employed to continuously monitor the environmental conditions affecting the degradation of the targeted structure. The sensor detects the frequency shift of vibrational behaviour in real-time, providing critical information on corrosion progress of steel bars in concrete. To modify the monitoring accuracy, Half-Cell Potential (HCP) measurement for rebars in concrete is conducted to correlate the corrosion of SAMS with the steel bars inside the concrete. Frequency changes detected by MEMS-SAMS strongly correlate to HCP data, confirming that MEMS-SAMS can effectively monitor the corrosion due to chloride attack.

However, as designers pursue more efficient structural designs and subject these structures to more aggressive environments, these systems become increasingly susceptible to corrosion. Corrosion of steel reinforcement is one of the more prevalent mechanisms of deterioration in reinforced concrete systems. As the world’s infrastructure ages, the cost of repair and replacement of these systems increase at rapid rates. As new models, designs, materials and construction methods become available, the service life of these systems should be extended. This Special Issue initially focuses on current practices used throughout the world to mitigate corrosion of the steel reinforcement embedded in concrete. Alexander et al., Li and Ueda, and Geiker et al. provide an overview for durability based design in South Africa, Asia and Europe. The authors note that both prescriptiveand performance-based methods are currently in use with the objective of ensuring durability. All authors note the use of models, especially models to predict the ingress of chlorides into concrete, should be used to better predict the service life. However, Alexander et al. critique exposure classifications and conclude that both rational service life designs and relevant environmental exposure classifications are sorely needed. The authors also recommend that exposure classifications account for the various factors that influence reinforcement corrosion and the resulting structural damage. Li and Ueda review the state-of-theart of durability design in Asia and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the current practices. The authors ultimately recommend a ‘multi-barrier’ strategy to achieve long-term performance and corrosion resistance of reinforced concrete systems. Geiker at al. provide a European perspective on durability design and argue that designers must understand basic deterioration mechanisms and resulting damage to better design the infrastructure systems. The authors also note that service life models should include the time from corrosion initiation to the end of life (i.e., the propagation phase) to provide more resilient designs. In addition to the design for durability perspectives from the different regions, understanding how to better predict and quantify factors that influence the service life are critical for improving resilience. Ogunsanya et al. present how the use of different de-icing chemicals can influence the critical chloride threshold, a critical parameter for assessing service life. Boschmann Käthler et al. present a review of how the critical chloride threshold values are assessed and make recommendations on how to quantify these critical chloride values. Interestingly, such a critical parameter for assessing the service life of reinforced concrete system has no standardized testing protocol (although advances are underway in several locales). Ahmed and Vaddey present interesting work on chloride testing of various cementitious systems and recommend that water-soluble chloride testing be used to quantify chlorides in concrete. Standardizing testing requirements are essential for ensuring corrosionresistant structures and yet the pursuit is on-going. Shakouri and Dhandapani & Santhanam focus on buildup and transport rates of chlorides in concrete systems. Shakouri reported on the surface build-up rate of chlorides and assesshow these build-up rates influence service life. He concluded that a universal test is needed to assess surface chlorides; interestingly, this is another critical input parameter for assessing the service life and yet there is limited standardization. Shakouri also reported the need for long-term field data. Dhandapani and Santhanam compared various test methods currently used to quantify chloride transport rates under various exposure conditions and report good correlation between several testing methods. Although much of the literature on chloride transport and service life of reinforced concrete systems focus on uncracked concrete, cracking in concrete is common. Yet limited work has been performed to assess how cracks influence corrosion and resulting service life of reinforced concrete systems. O’Reilly et al. assessed the corrosion performance of reinforced concrete specimens containing narrow cracks and reported that these narrow cracks can promote corrosion and potentially", "authors": "[\"D.

The study of the depth of carbonization of concrete is to determine the pH of the pore liquid at different depths. There are devices with automatic maintenance of a given concentration of carbon dioxide, to determine the diffusion permeability of concrete to carbon dioxide, based on data on the rate of neutralization (carbonization) of concrete with carbon dioxide. Basically, this method is intended for use in the development of technology and design of concrete composition, providing long-term maintenance of structures in non-aggressive and aggressive gaseous environments, as chips are not prepared immediately before the test and after reaching the design age are placed in the installation with reagents for 7 days. But to determine the carbonization directly on the construction site or object often use the pH method, i.e. the indicator method of pH determination.

This research covers the principal corrosion processes, including carbonation-induced and chloride-induced corrosion, which erode reinforcement and impair the lifetime of RC structures. Carbonation lowers concrete alkalinity, weakening the passive layer on steel, while chloride penetration causes localized pitting corrosion, leading to fast degradation. Key environmental and material elements impacting corrosion advancement, such as concrete permeability, water-to-cement ratio, exposure circumstances, and cyclic wet-dry environments, are investigated. Corrosion-induced mechanical deterioration, including cracking, loss of reinforcement cross-section, and bond strength reduction, is also examined. The study analyzes mitigating measures, stressing the significance of supplemental cementitious materials (SCMs) such as silica fume, fly ash, and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), which increase durability by lowering permeability and chloride diffusion. Additional preventive approaches, including corrosion inhibitors, epoxy-coated rebars, cathodic protection, and improved design codes, are explored. Advanced corrosion monitoring technologies, including non-destructive testing (NDT) methodologies and machine learning-based prediction models, offer new options for early corrosion identification and efficient maintenance planning. Findings reveal that combining corrosion-resistant materials with proactive maintenance procedures and real-time monitoring can greatly increase the service life of RC structures while lowering long-term repair costs.

In this study, the probability of steel depassivation was first estimated using climate variables—temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 concentration—predicted by a machine learning model (Random Forest) trained on historical data.

A series of experiments are conducted using concrete cube specimens, at a size of 200 mm, with a reinforcing steel bar (rebar) embedded in the center. The main variables include the water-to-cement ratio of the concrete (0.4, 0.5, and 0.6), the diameter of the rebar (10 mm, 13 mm, 19 mm, and 22 mm), and the corrosion level (ranging from 0% to 20% depending on rebar diameter). The impressed current technique is used to accelerate corrosion of rebars in concrete immersed in a 3% NaCl solution. Ultrasonic pulse waves are collected from the concrete specimens using a pair of 50 kHz P-wave transducers in the through-transmission configuration before and after the accelerated corrosion test. Deep learning techniques, specifically three recurrent neural network (RNN) models (long short-term memory, gated recurrent unit, and bidirectional long short-term memory), are utilized to develop a classification model for early detection of concrete damage due to rebar corrosion.

This study investigates the use of ANN-based approaches to predict the corrosion rates of mild steel reinforcement embedded in cementitious composites subjected to clay-dominated soil environments. Key environmental parameters, sodium chloride (NaCl) content (0-4%), inhibitor dosage (DOI) (0-5%), and exposure duration (30-180 days), were selected as input variables. Two ANN architectures, Feedforward Backpropagation (FFBP) and Cascadeforward Backpropagation (CFBP), were developed and trained using 72 experimental data points extracted from the literature. The FFBP model outperformed CFBP in terms of predictive accuracy, achieving a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.998, a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 30.43%, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.071 during testing. Sensitivity analysis revealed that inhibitor dosage had the most significant influence on corrosion behavior, followed by NaCl concentration and exposure duration. The findings confirm that ANN models can effectively capture the nonlinear interactions governing corrosion progression, even under complex environmental conditions associated with clayey soils. This research provides a reliable and practical AI-driven framework for assessing corrosion risk, guiding material design, and enhancing long-term infrastructure durability in aggressive subsurface conditions. The study underscores the growing relevance of machine learning in simulating time-dependent deterioration processes in geotechnical and structural materials.", "authors": "[\"Shahbaz Ahmad\", \"Siraj Ahmad\", \"Sabih Akhtar\", \"Faraz Ahmad\", \"M.

With due consideration of site-specific exposure and environmental conditions, this study aims to investigate the degree to which projected climate change may impact corrosion-induced damage for RC bridges. A hierarchical two-tier framework was developed incorporating the material deterioration process simulation at the local element level, and a component level prediction of the corrosion-induced damage severity and extent over the bridge deck domain. The predictive accuracy of this framework was validated against the historical bridge inspection data. Case studies were performed for decks located in Toronto and Victoria to investigate the influence of climate data resolution and climate projection models on deck deterioration status. At last, ANN (artificial neural network) and SVM (support vector machine) approaches were used to generate a series of cartographic expressions to reveal how the corrosion-induced deck deterioration risk varies with the region due to the difference in the environmental conditions. These maps can serve as visual tools to express the corrosion damage risks for different bridge locations and to formulate region-based durability design requirements.", "authors": "[\"Mingsai Xu\", \"Cancan Yang\"]", "venue": "Structure and Infrastructure Engineering", "year": 2023, "date": null, "relevance_score": 0.1, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": null, "file_size": null, "source": "semantic_scholar", "oa_status": "open", "topic": null, "full_content": null}

Corrosion related maintenance and repair of reinforced concrete structures cost multibillion USD per annum globally. It is often triggered by the ingression of carbon dioxide and/or chloride into the pores of concrete. Estimation of these corrosion causing factors using the conventional models results in suboptimal assessment since they are incapable of capturing the complex interaction of parameters. Hygrothermal interaction also plays a role in aggravating the corrosion of reinforcement bar and this is usually counteracted by applying surface-protection systems. These systems have different degree of protection and they may even cause deterioration to the structure unintentionally. The overall objective of this dissertation is to provide a framework that enhances the assessment reliability of the corrosion controlling factors. The framework is realized through the development of data-driven carbonation depth, chloride profile and hygrothermal performance prediction models. The carbonation depth prediction model integrates neural network, decision tree, boosted and bagged ensemble decision trees. The ensemble tree based chloride profile prediction models evaluate the significance of chloride ingress controlling variables from various perspectives. The hygrothermal interaction prediction models are developed using neural networks to evaluate the status of corrosion and other unexpected deteriorations in surface-treated concrete elements. Long-term data for all models were obtained from three different field experiments. The performance comparison of the developed carbonation depth prediction model with the conventional one confirmed the prediction superiority of the data-driven model.

This paper explores two modeling approaches to estimate the effective diffusion coefficient for chloride transport. The first approach follows Gehlen's interpretable diffusion model, which is based on established physical principles and incorporates time and temperature dependencies in predicting chloride migration. The second approach is a neural network-based method, where the neural network approximates the effective diffusion coefficient. In a subsequent step, the calibrated models are used to predict the penetration depth of the critical chloride content, taking into account the uncertainty in the critical chloride content. The models are calibrated using experimental data measured by a wire sensor installed in a concrete test bridge. The calibration results are compared to effective diffusion coefficients derived from drilling dust samples. A comparison of both approaches reveals the advantages of the physics-based model in terms of transparency and interpretability, while the neural network model demonstrates flexibility and adaptability in data-driven predictions. This study emphasizes the importance of combining traditional and machine learning-based methods to improve the accuracy of chloride migration predictions in reinforced concrete.", "authors": "[\"A.
