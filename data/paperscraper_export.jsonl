However, the combined effects of desert sand admixtures and long-term stress on freeze-thaw durability are insufficiently investigated. The existing research has focused on the material modification of desert sand concrete (DSC) or on the mechanical-environment coupling of ordinary concrete. This leaves a knowledge gap about how sustained compressive stress influences the macro- and mesoscale freeze-thaw behaviour of DSC. This study systematically investigated the freeze-thaw resistance of DSC under varying sustained compressive stresses. Testing methods and conditions were tailored to the climatic characteristics of China's high-altitude cold regions. Freeze-thaw degradation was assessed using mass loss, relative dynamic modulus of elasticity, and compressive strength. Controlled loading effectively mitigated freeze damage. After cyclic freeze-thaw, the 0.3 and 0.5 stress groups retained 89.36% and 77.92% of their original compressive strength, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy, mercury porosimetry, and CT scanning revealed mesoscale damage mechanisms. Sustained loading optimized pore structure and enhanced compactness.

Results show that nonlinear creep and cracking significantly aggravate deflection, a phenomenon poorly documented in prior studies. The analysis further reveals that downward-curved cantilever tendons are necessary to counter the unreliable prestressing effectiveness of threaded bars.

However, these structures are highly susceptible to chloride-induced corrosion, compromising their durability. Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) offers superior durability, but faces adoption barriers due to rigid design requirements and high costs, largely driven by steel fiber reinforcement. Recent advances in fiber technology and the development of greener cementitious materials created opportunities for alternative, sustainable, and cost-effective UHPC designs that could significantly enhance coastal infrastructure resilience, particularly as climate change intensifies natural hazards. However, data on the mechanical and long-term performance of such UHPC in harsh environments remain limited.

Results indicate that the laboratory-developed UHPC mixtures, whether damaged or undamaged, exhibited excellent resistance to marine exposure, showing limited degradation, and performing comparably to the commercial UHPC.

The hardened chalcedonite-based and reference quartz-based high-performance concretes were subjected to a comprehensive suite of tests to determine their physical properties (bulk density, water absorption, and capillary absorption) and mechanical properties (flexural and compressive strength). Durability was further assessed based on compressive strength criteria, including frost resistance and carbonation resistance. To simulate long-term performance and better evaluate the durability of the high-performance concretes, specimens were tested following standard water curing and after additional maturation processes, including thermal treatment, which in the extreme case resulted in a seven-day compressive strength of 176.9 MPa, a value higher by 56.7 MPa (corresponding to an increase of 47.1%) compared to the strength of the identical concrete not subjected to thermal treatment. To explore the potential for architectural applications, particularly in outdoor environments, capillary absorption testing was of particular importance, as it provided insight into the material's resistance to eventual pigment leaching from the mineral matrix.", "authors": "[\"Joanna JuliaSoko\\u0142owska\", \"PiotrWoyciechowski\", \"Szymon\\u017berek\"]", "venue": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "year": null, "date": null, "relevance_score": null, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": "cc-by", "file_size": null, "source": "paperscraper_pubmed", "oa_status": "publisher", "topic": null}

The motivation for conducting the research was the growing need to develop durable and ecological building materials that will be resistant to long-term exposure to moisture and aggressive chemical agents, typical for the underwater environment, where traditional cement concretes undergo gradual degradation due to long-term water impact, including hydrotechnical and underwater infrastructure. Geopolymer binders were produced based on metakaolin activated by alkaline solutions containing sodium hydroxide. Several series of mixtures with additives such as blast furnace slag, amphibolite and carbon fibers were developed to evaluate the effect of these components on mechanical strength, water absorption and chemical durability. The conducted studies showed that slag additions improved mechanical properties, for the best composition it across 50 MPa. In contrast, the addition of amphibolite had an unfavorable effect, which probably results from introducing inhomogeneity into the material structure. The presence of carbon fibers promoted matrix cohesion, but their uneven distribution could lead to local strength differences. Water absorption tests have shown that geopolymers reach full water saturation within 24 to 48 h, which indicates rapid establishment of capillary equilibrium and limited further water penetration.

A total of eleven SCC mixtures with varying fibre types and volume fractions (0.025-0.25%) were tested at 7 and 28 days. In this study, the term high-performance concrete (HPC) refers to SCC mixtures with a 28-day compressive strength exceeding 60 MPa, as commonly accepted in European standards and literature. The control SCC achieved 68.2 MPa at 28 days. While fibre addition enhanced the tensile and flexural properties, it reduced workability, demonstrating the trade-off between mechanical performance and flowability in high-performance SCC. The experimental results demonstrate that both fibre types improve the tensile behaviour of SCC, with distinct performance patterns. PP fibres, owing to their flexibility and crack-bridging capability, were particularly effective at early ages, enhancing the splitting tensile strength by up to 45% and flexural toughness by over 300% at an optimal dosage of 0.125%. In contrast, BF fibres significantly increased the 28-day toughness (up to 15.7 J) and post-cracking resistance due to their superior stiffness and bonding with the matrix. However, high fibre contents adversely affected workability, particularly in BF-reinforced mixes. The findings highlight a dosage-sensitive behaviour, with optimum performance observed at 0.05-0.125% for PP and 0.125-0.25% for BF. While PP fibres improve crack distribution and early-age ductility, BF fibres offer higher stiffness and energy absorption in post-peak regimes. Statistical analysis (ANOVA and Tukey's test) confirmed significant differences in the mechanical performance among fibre-reinforced mixes.

The model uses local corrosion current density as the primary variable to accurately measure the dynamic interactions among electrochemical processes, ion transport, and rust product precipitation.

As the number of F-T cycles increased, the failure mode shifted from splitting failure to push-out failure. After 50 F-T cycles, the bond strength of specimens with 380 mm and 560 mm anchorage lengths decreased to 82.2% and 84.7%, respectively, compared to the unexposed condition. Under the same F-T conditions, the pull-out force and bond strength of specimens with a 1.2% stirrup ratio were higher than those with 0.4%. The bond stress-slip curve shape remained generally consistent before and after F-T cycles, but the peak stress decreased and the slip at the peak load increased with more cycles. A regression model was also developed to describe bond strength degradation, providing a basis for predicting long-term performance. These findings clarify the deterioration pattern of steel-concrete bond under F-T conditions and offer a technical reference for the safety and durability assessment of composite structures in cold regions.", "authors": "[\"YongjunLin\", \"SihuaJiang\", \"ShuiyunZhong\", \"SongGuo\"]", "venue": "Scientific reports", "year": null, "date": null, "relevance_score": null, "status": "fetched", "local_path": "data\\paperscraper_pdfs\\10_1038_s41598-025-14424-y_id31.pdf", "pdf_path": "data\\paperscraper_pdfs\\10_1038_s41598-025-14424-y_id31.pdf", "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": null, "file_size": 3164587, "source": "paperscraper_pubmed", "oa_status": "publisher", "topic": null}

ECC demonstrates superior tensile, flexural, and compressive strength and durability, yet it exhibits a lower elastic modulus and greater drying shrinkage strain. RAC, as an eco-friendly concrete, offers cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits, although it poses certain performance challenges. The focus of this review is on how to enhance the load-bearing capacity of composite beams or slabs by modifying the interface roughness, adjusting the thickness of the ECC or UHPC layer, and altering the cross-sectional form. The integration of diverse concrete materials improves the performance of beam and slab elements while managing costs. For instance, increasing the thickness of the UHPC or ECC layer typically enhances the load-bearing capacity of composite beams or plates by approximately 10% to 40%. Increasing the roughness of the interface can significantly improve the interfacial bond strength and further augment the ultimate load-bearing capacity of composite components. Moreover, the optimized design of material mix proportions and cross-sectional shapes can also contribute to enhancing the load-bearing capacity, crack resistance, and ductility of composite components.

Excessive vibrations can negatively affect sensitive equipment, structural durability, and personnel comfort. With the rise of automation and high-precision processes, effective vibration control in floor systems is increasingly important. Traditional solutions like elastomer pads, rubber mats, or floating floors often have high installation costs, complex construction, and long-term degradation. Therefore, there is growing interest in integrated, durable alternatives that can be incorporated directly into concrete structures. One such approach uses rubber granulates from recycled tires as a modifying additive in cementitious composites. This can improve damping, enhance impact energy absorption, and reduce the need for external insulating layers. However, adding rubber particles to concrete may affect its compressive strength, a key design parameter. This article presents experimental research on concrete and mortar mixtures modified with rubber granulates for vibration-isolating industrial floor systems. The proposed solution combines a conventional concrete subbase with a rubber-enhanced mortar layer, forming a composite system to mitigate vibration transmission. Laboratory tests and real-scale verification under industrial conditions showed that the slab with hybrid EPDM/SBR rubber granulate mortar achieved the highest vibration-damping efficiency, reducing vertical acceleration by 58.6% compared to the reference slab.

Most data to date are from laboratory tests ranging from a few months to 1-2 years providing an insufficient dataset for prediction of long-term durability. This investigation focuses on the assessment of the response of three different prefabricated CFRP systems exposed to water, seawater, and alkaline solutions for 5 years of immersion in deionized water conducted at three temperatures of 23, 37.8 and 60 °C, all well below the glass transition temperature levels. Overall response is characterized through tensile and short beam shear (SBS) testing at periodic intervals. It is noted that while the three systems are similar, with the dominant mechanisms of deterioration being related to matrix plasticization followed by fiber-matrix debonding with levels of matrix and interface deterioration being accelerated at elevated temperatures, their baseline characteristics and distributions are different emphasizing the need for greater standardization. While tensile modulus does not degrade appreciably over the 5-year period of exposure with final levels of deterioration being between 7.3 and 11.9%, both tensile strength and SBS strength degrade substantially with increasing levels based on temperature and time of immersion. Levels of tensile strength retention can be as low as 61.8-66.6% when immersed in deionized water at 60 °C, those for SBS strength can be 38.4-48.7% at the same immersion condition for the three FRP systems. Differences due to solution type are wider in the short-term and start approaching asymptotic levels within FRP systems at longer periods of exposure. The very high levels of deterioration in SBS strength indicate the breakdown of the materials at the fiber-matrix bond and interfacial levels. It is shown that the level of deterioration exceeds that presumed through design thresholds set by specific codes/standards and that new safety factors are warranted in addition to expanding the set of characteristics studied to include SBS or similar interface-level tests. Alkali solutions are also shown to have the highest deteriorative effects with deionized water having the least.

Two ANN architectures, Feedforward Backpropagation (FFBP) and Cascadeforward Backpropagation (CFBP), were developed and trained using 72 experimental data points extracted from the literature.

Traditional methods for studying the frost resistance of concrete in permafrost regions do not provide a complete picture for predicting properties, and new approaches are needed using, for example, machine learning algorithms. This study utilizes four machine learning models-Support Vector Machine (SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM), long short-term memory (LSTM), and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)-to predict freeze-thaw damage factors in concrete under low and subzero temperature conservation conditions. Building on the prediction results, the optimal model is refined to develop a new machine learning model: the Sparrow Search Algorithm-optimized Extreme Learning Machine (SSA-ELM). Furthermore, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analysis method is employed to interpret this model, clarifying the relationship between factors affecting the freezing resistance of concrete and freeze-thaw damage factors. In conclusion, the empirical formula for concrete freeze-thaw damage is compared and validated against the prediction results from the SSA-ELM model. The study results indicate that the SSA-ELM model offers the most accurate predictions for concrete freeze-thaw resistance compared to the SVM, ELM, LSTM, and RBFNN models. SHAP value analysis quantitatively confirms that the number of freeze-thaw cycles is the most significant input parameter affecting the freeze-thaw damage coefficient of concrete. Comparative analysis shows that the accuracy of the SSA-ELMDE prediction set is improved by 15.46%, 9.19%, 21.79%, and 11.76%, respectively, compared with the prediction results of SVM, ELM, LSTM, and RBF. This parameter positively influences the prediction results for the freeze-thaw damage coefficient. Curing humidity has the least influence on the freeze-thaw damage factor of concrete. Comparing the prediction results with empirical formulas shows that the machine learning model provides more accurate predictions.

This review comprehensively examines the influence of hybrid fiber compositions on UHPC, focusing on mechanical performance and resistance to environmental degradation. Hybrid fibers, which combine steel and synthetic and basalt fibers, improve compressive, tensile, and flexural strengths by bridging microcracks and limiting macrocrack propagation. Studies reveal that steel fiber combinations, particularly those with varying lengths and shapes, significantly improve ductility and load-bearing capacity, while steel-synthetic hybrids balance strength and flexibility. However, excessive synthetic fibers can reduce compressive strength. Basalt-synthetic hybrids, though less effective in compression, excel in tensile strength and crack resistance. Durability assessments highlight the superior resistance of UHPCs to chloride penetration, carbonation, freeze-thaw cycles, and high temperatures, and hybrid fibers further mitigate spalling and permeability. Polypropylene fibers, for instance, enhance fire resistance by creating vapor release channels. The challenge of optimizing fiber proportions and mix designs remains to minimize trade-offs between strength and workability.

Understanding load transfer from sleepers to ballast is key to improve railway durability and performance. This study examines the settlement behavior of turnout sleepers and the pressure distribution beneath them in a large-scale laboratory ballast box test. Cyclic loading tests were conducted on a long concrete sleeper with and without under sleeper pads (USP) to compare their load transfer characteristics and settlement behavior. For this laser displacement sensors and pressure mapping sensors (Getzner Sensor Sleeper technology) were used. A vertical cyclic load, oscillating between 5 kN and 160 kN at frequencies of 3 Hz to 5 Hz, was applied to one side of the turnout sleeper, while a constant load of 10 kN was applied to the opposite side to represent the structural stiffness of the turnout. For each test configuration more than four million load cycles were carried out. The sleeper showed a degressive settlement pattern with asymmetric distribution. The use of USP resulted in more uniform and gradual settlement, more uniform pressure distribution and reduction of pressure peaks over time. Additionally, the sleeper deformation caused by the load was mitigated and the occurrence of voids underneath the sleeper was significantly reduced. The sleeper with elasto-plastic USP show larger initial oscillation amplitudes due to the pad's elasticity, which stabilizes over time.", "authors": "[\"GernotGrohs\", \"PaulPircher\", \"MartinQuirchmair\", \"HaraldLoy\", \"KlausSix\", \"FerdinandPospischil\"]", "venue": "Scientific reports", "year": null, "date": null, "relevance_score": null, "status": "fetched", "local_path": "data\\paperscraper_pdfs\\10_1038_s41598-025-01751-3_id60.pdf", "pdf_path": "data\\paperscraper_pdfs\\10_1038_s41598-025-01751-3_id60.pdf", "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": "cc-by", "file_size": 5440177, "source": "paperscraper_pubmed", "oa_status": "publisher", "topic": null}

However, as a construction material, its long-term performance is highly dependent on its service environment, particularly ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This research focuses on examining the influence of UV exposure and managing the admixtures employed in concrete and investigating the effects of UV radiation on the appearance quality, pore distribution, and micro-composition of fair-faced concrete. Results indicate that UV radiation enhances moisture evaporation, increases surface and bulk porosity, and accelerates carbonation and early hydration reactions, forming more calcite on the surface. These factors degrade the appearance quality of fair-faced concrete. To mitigate UV-aging damage, two common anti-UV admixtures, nano-silica (NS) and water-based fluorocarbon paint (FC), were evaluated. Results show that both admixtures effectively improve the UV-resistance of fair-faced concrete, particularly when combined. The FC+NS group reduced the surface glossiness loss rate from 28.63% to 12.95% after 28 days of UV exposure, with surface porosity and maximum pore diameter recorded at 0.157% and 3.66 mm, respectively, indicating excellent appearance quality.

This research examines the influence of the particle size distribution of aggregates on the filter properties of permeable concrete for applications in geotechnical engineering (draining piles, deep trench drains, and draining backfill). It emphasizes the importance of resistance to clogging to maintain adequate residual hydraulic conductivity and to prevent the internal erosion of soils into which permeable concrete drains are installed. The experimental results indicate that including sand in the aggregates strongly enhances the filtering capacity of pervious concrete. These findings suggest that if the mix design of permeable concrete is developed considering the grain size distribution of the base soils, the concrete will meet long-term drainage requirements (sufficient residual hydraulic conductivity), exhibit good resistance to physical clogging, provide excellent protection for the base soils against internal erosion, and contribute to the overall stability of geotechnical systems.", "authors": "[\"MaurizioZiccarelli\"]", "venue": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "year": null, "date": null, "relevance_score": null, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": "cc-by", "file_size": null, "source": "paperscraper_pubmed", "oa_status": "publisher", "topic": null}

A fly ash content of 20% by weight of the binder resulted in an increase of 26% in compressive strength and about 6% in thermal conductivity compared to hemp concrete without mineral additives. The use of metakaolin in the amount of 15% by weight of the binder resulted in a 21% increase in compressive strength values with an increase in the thermal conductivity coefficient of only 0.5%. Flammability tests by direct application of a gas torch flame to the specimen surface proved the lack of flammability and spontaneous fire extinguishing ability of hempcrete. In turn, fire resistance tests showed much higher resistance to high temperatures for hempcrete modified with metakaolin, where the recorded mass loss during a 15 min test at 500 °C was ca. 58% less than in hempcrete without mineral additives, and when FBC fly ash was used, the mass loss was ca. 37% less. The obtained results are satisfactory in terms of the physico-mechanical properties of hempcrete.

Damage detection is a common approach in infrastructure that combines steel and concrete reinforcement to achieve optimal durability and structural strength. These bridges, designed to withstand diverse loads such as seismic forces, traffic weight, and environmental factors, are significant for maintaining structural integrity. Damage detection comprises applying advanced structural health monitoring methods to identify and assess potential deterioration or damage in concrete bridge components. Machine learning (ML) models, pattern detection, and statistical analysis are extensively adopted to identify subtle changes and process sensor information in structural response that might indicate corrosion, cracks, or other structural problems. Earlier detection and continuous monitoring of damage enable prompt intervention, ensuring longevity and safety while reducing the need for extensive repairs or the risk of unexpected failures. This study proposes an Automated Damage Detection using a Modified Seagull Optimizer with Ensemble Learning (ADD-MSGOEL) method for visually impaired people. The ADD-MSGOEL method is designed to enhance the social life and daily functioning of visually impaired people by accurately detecting damage and potential hazards in their surroundings. Initially, the ADD-MSGOEL method utilizes contrast enhancement (CLAHE) to enhance the image quality. Next, the features are extracted using the Dilated Convolution Block Attention Module with EfficientNet (DCBAM-EfficientNet) module, which derives the intrinsic and complex features. Moreover, the MSGO model is employed to choose the optimal parameter for the DCBAM-EfficientNet module. At last, an ensemble of three models, namely long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU), and sparse autoencoder (SAE) models, are implemented for the classification and detection of the damages.

Understanding the corrosion products and mechanisms are crucial scientific and technological factors in ensuring the durability and service life of concrete structures in these regions. In this study, various analytical techniques-including X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis, X-ray fluorescence, and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive spectroscopy-were employed to systematically analyze the corrosion products of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and high-performance concrete (HPC) specimens after eight years of field exposure in the Qarhan Salt Lake area of Qinghai. The study provided an in-depth understanding of the physicochemical corrosion mechanisms involved. The results showed that, after eight years of exposure, the corrosion products comprised both physical corrosion products (primarily sodium chloride crystals), and chemical corrosion products (associated with chloride, sulfate, and magnesium salt attacks). A strong correlation could be observed between the chemical corrosion products and the strength grade of the concrete. In C25 OPC, the detected corrosion products included gypsum, monosulfate-type calcium sulfoaluminate (AFm), Friedel's salt, chloro-ettringite, brucite, magnesium oxychloride hydrate 318, calcium carbonate, potassium chloride, and sodium chloride. In C60 HPC, the identified corrosion products included Kuzel's salt, Friedel's salt, chloro-ettringite, brucite, calcium carbonate, potassium chloride, and sodium chloride. Among them, sulfate-induced corrosion led to the formation of gypsum and AFm, whereas chloride-induced corrosion resulted in chloro-ettringite and Friedel's salt. Magnesium salt corrosion contributed to the formation of brucite and magnesium oxychloride hydrate 318, with Kuzel's salt emerging as a co-corrosion product of chloride and sulfate attacks. Furthermore, a conversion phenomenon was evident between the sulfate and chloride corrosion products, which was closely linked to the internal chloride ion concentration in the concrete. As the chloride ion concentration increased, the transformation sequence of sulfate corrosion products occurred in the following order: AFm → Kuzel's salt → Friedel's salt → chloro-ettringite. There was a gradual increase in chloride ion content within these corrosion products.

This study employs high-resolution X-ray computed tomography (X-CT) to thoroughly assess how steam curing temperatures and various subsequent curing regimes influence the pore characteristics of mortars containing high volumes of mineral admixtures. The results shows that steam-cured specimens under water curing (ST8012-WA) achieved a compressive strength of 51.72 MPa and flexural strength of 5.85 MPa, representing improvements of 9% and 19.8%, respectively, compared to natural curing (ST8012-NA: 47.32 MPa and 4.88 MPa). The standard-cured specimen (SD) exhibited the highest compressive strength of 54.18 MPa, highlighting the detrimental effects of elevated steam curing temperatures.

Two types of durability tests were conducted: freeze-thaw and chloride penetration. Fiber ratios of 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, and 2 wt%, along with a 0 wt% control, were used for freeze-thaw testing, while ratios of 0.24 wt%, 0.36 wt%, 0.5 wt%, 1 wt%, and 2 wt% were used for chloride penetration.

Active fiber-reinforced concrete exhibited over 200% greater freeze-thaw durability than passive fibers and over 500% compared to non-reinforced concrete.

In addition, it is concluded that the effectiveness of TRAAM can be comparable with that of \"conventional\" TRM systems. The combination of TRAAM with thermal insulation boards has also been proposed for structural and energy upgrading of masonry walls. Furthermore, TRAAM can be a promising solution for increasing the fire resistance of strengthened masonry members.

The underlying mechanisms governing corrosion product precipitation in macroscopic voids and their effects on long-term durability remain unclear. Through in-situ X-ray computed tomography observations, thermodynamic and kinetic considerations, and numerical modelling of water transport within macroscopic voids, here, we provide plausible hypotheses of the processes responsible for the precipitation of corrosion products along the walls of the voids. Understanding the mechanisms of corrosion product precipitation can offer insights into the development of stresses in and around the macroscopic interfacial void and the durability of reinforced concrete structures.

Waste-based supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) offer a partial cement replacement to address climate goals.

GGBS, sourced from steel production, was used at 20% and 40%, while biochar, derived from wood waste through pyrolysis, was incorporated at 3%, 4%, and 5% by weight of cement. The effects of these replacements were evaluated through compressive strength tests at 7 and 28 days, as well as microstructural analyses employing scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. Findings revealed that GGBS enhanced workability due to its finer particles and pozzolanic activity while aiding long-term strength development.

In this study, ECO-UHPC was prepared by substituting quartz sand with gold tailing sand (GTS) at substitution rates of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. The mechanical properties of ECO-UHPC, including its cubic compressive strength, elastic modulus, and prismatic compressive strength, as well as its leaching toxicity, were experimentally analyzed under various early curing experiences such as ambient-water curing (WC), hot-water curing (HWC), hot-air curing (HAC), and combined curing (CC). Additionally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) were employed to interpret the macroscopic behavior of ECO-UHPC. The results indicate that the incorporation of waste GTS slightly reduces the fluidity of fresh ECO-UHPC, decreasing it by approximately 6.1% at a full 100% replacement. As a result of waste GTS substitution, the cubic strength of ECO-UHPC experiencing the WC environment during early curing is reduced by 0.7-12.2%. However, the strength of thermally cured ECO-UHPC is comparable to or even higher than that of pure quartz-based G0, with the maximum value occurring in G-50. Specifically, the strength of G-50 cured with HWC, HAC, and CC varies by +20.0%, +40.2%, and +57.7%, respectively, as compared to that of G-50 cured with WC. The evolution of the elastic modulus and the prismatic strength of ECO-UHPC under different early curing conditions and GTS replacement rates aligns closely with that of its cubic strength. In addition, the implementation of thermal curing conditions also limits the leaching of heavy metals from ECO-UHPC, with the best effect observed under CC. This is because appropriate thermal curing promotes the densification of a cementitious substance and the bonding of GTS-cementitious material. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing waste GTS as a partial or full replacement for quartz sand in ECO-UHPC while maintaining desirable mechanical performance and environmental safety. The findings provide valuable insights into the influence of GTS substitution and early curing regimes on ECO-UHPC properties, highlighting the potential of thermal curing to enhance strength and mitigate leaching risks.

Therefore, understanding their resistance to chloride ion-induced corrosion under compression is crucial. This study investigates the effects of macro polypropylene fibers and macro steel fibers on the chloride permeability and damage of concrete under uniaxial compression. Ultrasonic testing is performed before and after the uniaxial compression test to assess the damage to concrete specimens at different stress levels. Simultaneously, the Rapid Chloride Migration test is conducted on the specimens subjected to various compressive stress levels. The results reveal that the chloride permeability of concrete is influenced by the stress level after uniaxial compression. Additionally, a threshold phenomenon is observed in the chloride permeability: after reaching the threshold stress level, the chloride diffusion coefficient increases significantly.

A study of the durability of nano-alumina (NA)-modified concrete by sulfate erosion was carried out. The results showed that the compressive strength, quality, and permeability of concrete to chloride ions decreased during its long-term erosion by a sodium sulfate solution. The NA-modified concrete exhibited higher resistance to erosion by the sodium sulfate than ordinary concrete (OPC), the rate of reduction in its tensile strength was low, and the resistance of sample NA1 to penetration by chloride ions decreased only by one-fifth compared with that of OPC.

However, the pile foundations of offshore wind turbines are subject to long-term erosion in the harsh marine environment, and the problem of corrosion damage is prominent, which seriously threatens the safe and stable operation of the wind power system. In view of this, a meshless numerical simulation method based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and a method for generating the concrete meso-structures are developed. Concrete pile foundation models with different aggregate contents, particle sizes, and ion concentration diffusion coefficients are established to simulate the corrosion damage processes under various conditions. The rationality of the numerical algorithm is verified by a typical example. The results show that the increase in the aggregate percentage gradually reduces the diffusion rate of chemical ions, and the early damage development also slows down. However, as time goes, the damage will still accumulate continuously; when the aggregate particle size increases, the ion diffusion becomes more difficult, the damage initiation is delayed, and the early damage is concentrated around the large aggregates. The increase in the ion diffusion coefficient significantly accelerates the ion diffusion process, promotes the earlier and faster development of damage, and significantly deepens the damage degree. The research results contribute to a deeper understanding of the corrosion damage mechanisms of pile foundations and providing important theoretical support for optimizing the durability design of pile foundations.

This paper presents the early age experimental characterization as well as the results of subsequent simulations of a typical UHPC matrix. Performed and simulated tests include unconfined compression, splitting (Brazilian), and three-point-bending tests. The computational framework is formulated by coupling a hygro-thermo-chemical (HTC) theory and a comprehensive mesoscale discrete model with formulated aging functions. The HTC component allows taking into account various types of curing conditions with varying temperature and relative humidity and predicting the level of concrete aging. The mechanical component, the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM), permits the simulation of the failure behavior of concrete at the length scale of major heterogeneities. The aging functions relate the mesoscale LDPM mechanical properties in terms of aging degree, defined in this work as the ratio between the quasi-static elastic modulus at a certain age and its asymptotic value.

Corrosion related maintenance and repair of reinforced concrete structures cost multibillion USD per annum globally. It is often triggered by the ingression of carbon dioxide and/or chloride into the pores of concrete. Estimation of these corrosion causing factors using the conventional models results in suboptimal assessment since they are incapable of capturing the complex interaction of parameters. Hygrothermal interaction also plays a role in aggravating the corrosion of reinforcement bar and this is usually counteracted by applying surface-protection systems. These systems have different degree of protection and they may even cause deterioration to the structure unintentionally. The overall objective of this dissertation is to provide a framework that enhances the assessment reliability of the corrosion controlling factors. The framework is realized through the development of data-driven carbonation depth, chloride profile and hygrothermal performance prediction models. The carbonation depth prediction model integrates neural network, decision tree, boosted and bagged ensemble decision trees. The ensemble tree based chloride profile prediction models evaluate the significance of chloride ingress controlling variables from various perspectives. The hygrothermal interaction prediction models are developed using neural networks to evaluate the status of corrosion and other unexpected deteriorations in surface-treated concrete elements. Long-term data for all models were obtained from three different field experiments.

Cracks are thin and rough and being air filled do yield a very weak contrast in 3D images obtained by computed tomography. Enhancing and segmenting dark lower-dimensional structures is already demanding. The heterogeneous concrete matrix and the size of the images further increase the complexity. ML methods have proven to solve difficult segmentation problems when trained on enough and well annotated data. However, so far, there is not much 3D image data of cracks available at all, let alone annotated. Interactive annotation is error-prone as humans can easily tell cats from dogs or roads without from roads with cars but have a hard time deciding whether a thin and dark structure seen in a 2D slice continues in the next one. Training networks by synthetic, simulated images is an elegant way out, bears however its own challenges. In this contribution, we describe how to generate semi-synthetic image data to train CNN like the well known 3D U-Net or random forests for segmenting cracks in 3D images of concrete. The thickness of real cracks varies widely, both, within one crack as well as from crack to crack in the same sample. The segmentation method should therefore be invariant with respect to scale changes. We introduce the so-called RieszNet, designed for exactly this purpose.

Moreover, if eigenvectors are known it is not more nec-essary to use invariants of the stress tensor for the formulation of loading surface. In the present model the loading surface is represented in the polynomial form. This has two advantages: (i) it automatically fulfils C1 continuity and (ii) plane stress formulation is achieved by simply setting the third stress to zero.

Pitting corrosion is investigated, elucidating the effects of the concrete porosity and water saturation, the presence of dissolved oxygen, and chlorine concentration within the pore solution. The presented model is capable of capturing the dynamic growth of acidic regions around corrosion pits, showing the limited region over which the hydrogen evolution reaction occurs and how this region evolves over time. The ability of oxygen to diffuse towards the metal surface due to increased porosity is seen to have a major effect on the corrosion rate, whereas changes in the chlorine concentration (and thus changes in the conductivity of the pore solution) play a secondary role.

Although it is well known that accelerated impressed current tests lead to slower propagation of cracks (with respect to corrosion penetration) than in natural conditions, which results in overestimations of the delamination/spalling time, the origins of this phenomenon have puzzled researchers for more than a quarter of a century. In view of recent experimental findings, it is postulated that the phenomenon can be attributed to the variability of rust composition and density, specifically to the variable ratio of the mass fractions of iron oxide and iron hydroxide-oxide, which is affected by the magnitude of the applied corrosion current density. Based on this hypothesis, a corrosion-induced cracking model for virtual impressed-current testing is presented. The simulation results obtained with the proposed model are validated against experimental data, showing good agreement.

Here, we report on the application of bimodal X-ray and neutron microtomography as in-situ imaging techniques to elucidate the mechanism of steel corrosion in concrete. The study demonstrates that the segmentation of the specimen components of relevance - steel, cementitious matrix, aggregates, voids, corrosion products - obtained through bimodal X-ray and neutron imaging is more reliable than that based on the results of each of the two techniques separately. Further, we suggest the combination of tomographic in-situ imaging with ex-situ SEM analysis of targeted sections, selected on the basis of the segmented tomograms. These in-situ and ex-situ characterization techniques were applied to study localized corrosion in a very early stage, on reinforced concrete cores retrieved from a concrete bridge. A number of interesting observations were made. First, the acquired images revealed the formation of several corrosion sites close to each other. Second, the morphology of the corrosion pits was relatively shallow. Finally, only about half of the total 31 corrosion initiation spots were in close proximity to interfacial macroscopic air voids, and above 90 percent of the more than 160 interfacial macroscopic air voids were free from corrosion.

The latter layout, though typical of laboratory specimens, could not represent the norm of structures in real-life. Thus, a new test methodology to investigate the strain distribution in concrete prismatic members reinforced with multiple bars subjected to axial tension is devised. Prismatic concrete specimens with different reinforcement configurations were fabricated and tested using the proposed setup. Deformation behavior of the specimens is modeled with a tailor-designed bond modeling approach for rigorous finite element analysis. It is revealed that the average deformations of the concrete could be different from the prevailing approach of average deformations of the steel, and are dependent on the reinforcement configurations. Therefore, the efficiency of concrete in tension should be carefully taken into account for rational design of structural elements.

Five tomograms, spanning volumes ranging from 8,000 to 200,000 cubic micrometer, were acquired for situations representative of both non-corroded and corroded SCIs.

This paper explores two modeling approaches to estimate the effective diffusion coefficient for chloride transport. The first approach follows Gehlen's interpretable diffusion model, which is based on established physical principles and incorporates time and temperature dependencies in predicting chloride migration. The second approach is a neural network-based method, where the neural network approximates the effective diffusion coefficient. In a subsequent step, the calibrated models are used to predict the penetration depth of the critical chloride content, taking into account the uncertainty in the critical chloride content. The models are calibrated using experimental data measured by a wire sensor installed in a concrete test bridge. The calibration results are compared to effective diffusion coefficients derived from drilling dust samples. A comparison of both approaches reveals the advantages of the physics-based model in terms of transparency and interpretability, while the neural network model demonstrates flexibility and adaptability in data-driven predictions.

To address this and anticipate such unexpected events, this study adopts surrogate modeling as an efficient probabilistic design approach. This methodology integrates key geometric parameters as random variables, capturing the uncertainties that may arise during the design and construction phases and propagating them on the bridge's performance functions. By doing so, we aim to enable the efficient exploration of a large number of design scenarios with minimal reliance on time-consuming finite element (FE) simulations, represent the performance functions of a reinforced concrete bridge as a function of our variable design parameters, and classify the overall design scenarios into failure and safe scenarios In this study, a four-span reinforced concrete bridge deck is modeled using a multi-fiber finite element approach in Cast3M software.

Due to its substantial volume and poor thermal conductivity, the accumulation of hydration heat during the curing process can lead to uneven temperature gradients and stress field distribution, which may cause structural cracking. This phenomenon represents one of the critical challenges in quality control for hydraulic dams, bridge piers and abutments, tunnel linings, and similar engineering structures. To ensure structural safety, it is imperative to calculate temperature variations while optimizing and controlling the temperature stress field. In this paper, a novel method for calculating the zero-stress temperature field is proposed, considering the temperature history and hydration heat release increments at various locations within mass concrete during the curing period, the parameter of average forming temperature field is defined to subsequently solve the temperature stress field. Several typical hydration heat release models were selected to calibrate the computational accuracy of the average forming temperature. Based on simulation results, an optimal model was applied to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through practical engineering case studies. The impacts of casting temperature, ambient temperature during the curing period, and dimensional thickness on temperature-induced stresses were systematically investigated.

Many meta programming systems process abstract syntax trees, but this requires intimate knowledge of the structure of the data type describing the abstract syntax. As a result, meta programming is error-prone, and meta programs are not resilient to evolution of the structure of such ASTs, requiring invasive, fault-prone change to these programs. Inquiry: Concrete syntax patterns alleviate this problem by allowing the meta programmer to match and create syntax trees using the actual syntax of the object language. Systems supporting concrete syntax patterns, however, require a concrete grammar of the object language in their own formalism. Creating such grammars is a costly and error-prone process, especially for realistic languages such as Java and C++.  Approach: In this paper we present Concretely, a technique to extend meta programming systems with pluggable concrete syntax patterns, based on external, black box parsers. We illustrate Concretely in the context of Rascal, an open-source meta programming system and language workbench, and show how to reuse existing parsers for Java, JavaScript, and C++. Furthermore, we propose Tympanic, a DSL to declaratively map external AST structures to Rascal's internal data structures. Tympanic allows implementors of Concretely to solve the impedance mismatch between object-oriented class hierarchies in Java and Rascal's algebraic data types. Both the algebraic data type and AST marshalling code is automatically generated. Knowledge: The conceptual architecture of Concretely and Tympanic supports the reuse of pre-existing, external parsers, and their AST representation in meta programming systems that feature concrete syntax patterns for matching and constructing syntax trees. As such this opens up concrete syntax pattern matching for a host of realistic languages for which writing a grammar from scratch is time consuming and error-prone, but for which industry-strength parsers exist in the wild. Grounding: We evaluate Concretely in terms of source lines of code (SLOC), relative to the size of the AST data type and marshalling code. We show that for real programming languages such as C++ and Java, adding support for concrete syntax patterns takes an effort only in the order of dozens of SLOC. Similarly, we evaluate Tympanic in terms of SLOC, showing an order of magnitude of reduction in SLOC compared to manual implementation of the AST data types and marshalling code. Importance: Meta programming has applications in reverse engineering, reengineering, source code analysis, static analysis, software renovation, domain-specific language engineering, and many others. Processing of syntax trees is central to all of these tasks. Concrete syntax patterns improve the practice of constructing meta programs. The combination of Concretely and Tympanic has the potential to make concrete syntax patterns available with very little effort, thereby improving and promoting the application of meta programming in the general software engineering context.", "authors": "[\"Rodin Aarssen\", \"Jurgen Vinju\", \"Tijs van der Storm\"]", "venue": "The Art, Science, and Engineering of Programming, 2019, Vol. 3, Issue 3, Article 15", "year": null, "date": null, "relevance_score": null, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": null, "file_size": null, "source": "paperscraper_arxiv", "oa_status": "fulltext_pdf", "topic": null}

The discovery of lower-carbon concrete formulae is therefore of high significance for sustainability. However, experimenting with new concrete formulae is time consuming and labor intensive, as one usually has to wait to record the concrete's 28-day compressive strength, a quantity whose measurement can by its definition not be accelerated. This provides an opportunity for experimental design methodology like Bayesian Optimization (BO) to accelerate the search for strong and sustainable concrete formulae. Herein, we 1) propose modeling steps that make concrete strength amenable to be predicted accurately by a Gaussian process model with relatively few measurements, 2) formulate the search for sustainable concrete as a multi-objective optimization problem, and 3) leverage the proposed model to carry out multi-objective BO with real-world strength measurements of the algorithmically proposed mixes. Our experimental results show improved trade-offs between the mixtures' global warming potential (GWP) and their associated compressive strengths, compared to mixes based on current industry practices.

Common topics include, but are not limited to, localisation of rebar or tendon ducts, geometrical irregularities, cracks, voids, honeycombing or other flaws. Non-destructive techniques such as ultrasound or radar have found regular, successful practical application but sometimes suffer from limited resolution and accuracy, imaging artefacts or restrictions in detecting certain features. Until the 1980s X-ray transmission was used in case of special demands and showed a resolution much higher than other NDT techniques. However, due to safety concerns and cost issues, this method is almost never used anymore. Muon tomography has received much attention recently. Novel detectors for cosmic muons and tomographic imaging algorithms have opened up new fields of application, such as the investigation of freight containers for contraband or the assessment of the contents of radioactive waste containers. But Muon imaging also has the potential to fill some of the gaps currently existing in concrete NDT. As a first step towards practical use and as a proof of concept we used an existing system to image the interior of a reference reinforced 600 kg concrete block. Even with a yet not optimized setup for this kind of investigation, the muon imaging results show more resolution and less distortion compared to ultrasonic and radar imaging. The data acquisition takes more time and signals contain more noise, but the images allowed to detect the same important features that are visible in conventional high energy x-ray tomography. In our experiment, we have shown the tremendous potential of muon imaging for concrete inspection.

Permeable floors can be made of concrete and are called permeable concrete. This research aims to analyze the use of polypropylene fibers in the mixture of permeable concrete to assess whether the fibers significantly alter the properties of this type of concrete, such as compression resistance and flexure tensile strength. For the tests, three concrete mixes of permeable concrete were first used to determine the reference of the composition of concrete: 1:3, without the use of sand and with water-to-cement ratio (w/c) equal to 0.32; 1:4, with the use of 10\\% of coarse sand and w/c of 0.35; and finally 1:5, with the use of 10\\% of coarse sand and w/c of 0.35; and finally 1:5, using 10\\% of coarse sand and w/c of 0.35. In these concrete mixes, tests were performed to determine their mechanical properties being them: permeability, compression resistance, and flexure tensile strength. After the reference concrete mix was determined, three more concrete mixes were made using polypropylene fibers, at levels of 0.6 kg/m$^3$, 1.8 kg/m$^3$, and 3.0 kg/m$^3$. The same initial tests were then carried out for concrete with the addition of fibers. The analysis of the results showed that the concrete mix that achieved the best result for the flexure tensile strength test, which was the main focus of the research, was the 1:4 trait with the addition of 1.8 kg/m$^3$.", "authors": "[\"Rebeca de M.

Our experimental findings highlight that distant image sources have a negligible effect on the acquired diffusive properties, suggesting that the number of image sources considered should be determined based on their maximum contribution to the main energy.

Consequently, modeling large structural systems entirely with LDPM leads to a tremendous number of degrees of freedom and is not feasible with the currently available computational resources. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes the formulation of a coarse-grained model obtained by (1) increasing the actual size of the particles in the fine-scale model by a specific coarsening factor and (2) calibrating the parameters of the coarse grained model by best fitting the macroscopic, average response of the coarse grained model to the corresponding fine scale one for different loading conditions. A Representative Volume Element (RVE) of LDPM is employed to obtain the macroscopic response of the fine scale and coarse grained models through a homogenization procedure.

TCSM provides a general framework with broad applicability. It supports pre-training discrete diffusion models directly from data samples, and many existing discrete diffusion approaches naturally emerge as special cases of our more general TCSM framework. Furthermore, the same TCSM objective extends to post-training of discrete diffusion models, including fine-tuning using reward functions or preference data, and distillation of knowledge from pre-trained autoregressive models. These new capabilities stem from the core idea of TCSM, estimating the concrete score of the target distribution, which resides in the original (clean) data space. This allows seamless integration with reward functions and pre-trained models, which inherently only operate in the clean data space rather than the noisy intermediate spaces of diffusion processes.

Proofs constructed in our logic also provide conventional asymptotic security guarantees because of the way that concrete bounds accumulate in proofs. As an illustrative example, we use the formal logic to prove an authentication property with concrete bounds of a signature-based challenge-response protocol.", "authors": "[\"Anupam Datta\", \"Joseph Y.

Buildings and structures are neither inherently susceptible to fire nor completely fire-resistant; their vulnerability largely depends on the specific causes of the fire, which can stem from natural events or human-induced hazards. High temperatures in structures can lead to severe health risks for those directly affected, discomfort due to smoke, and compromised safety if the structure fails to meet safety standards. Elevated temperatures can also cause significant structural damage, becoming the primary cause of casualties, economic losses, and material damage. This study aims to investigate the thermal and structural behavior of concrete beams when exposed to extreme fire conditions. It examines the effects of different temperatures on plain and reinforced concrete (PCC and RCC, respectively) using finite element method (FEM) simulations. Additionally, the study explores the performance of various concrete grades under severe conditions. The analysis reveals that higher-grade concrete exhibits greater displacement, crack width, stress, and strain but has lower thermal conductivity compared to lower-grade concrete. These elevated temperatures can induce severe stresses in the concrete, leading to expansion, spalling, and the potential failure of the structure. Reinforced concrete, on the other hand, shows lower stress concentrations and minimal strain up to 250°C.

Unfortunately, with that scale comes a significant burden in terms of energy, water, and release of greenhouse gases and other pollutants; indeed 8% of worldwide carbon emissions are attributed to the production of cement, a key ingredient in concrete. As such, there is interest in creating concrete formulas that minimize this environmental burden, while satisfying engineering performance requirements including compressive strength. Specifically for computing, concrete is a major ingredient in the construction of data centers.\n  In this work, we use conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs), a type of semi-supervised generative artificial intelligence (AI) model, to discover concrete formulas with desired properties. Our model is trained just using a small open dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository joined with environmental impact data from standard lifecycle analysis. Computational predictions demonstrate CVAEs can design concrete formulas with much lower carbon requirements than existing formulations while meeting design requirements. Next we report laboratory-based compressive strength experiments for five AI-generated formulations, which demonstrate that the formulations exceed design requirements. The resulting formulations were then used by Ozinga Ready Mix -- a concrete supplier -- to generate field-ready concrete formulations, based on local conditions and their expertise in concrete design.

However, since different apps may implement the same functionality in different ways, direct mapping may result in incomplete or buggy test cases, thus significantly impacting the effectiveness of testing target functionality and the practical applicability of migration approaches.\n  In this paper, we propose a new migration paradigm (i.e., the abstraction-concretization paradigm) that first abstracts the test logic for the target functionality and then utilizes this logic to generate the concrete GUI test case. Furthermore, we introduce MACdroid, the first approach that migrates GUI test cases based on this paradigm. Specifically, we propose an abstraction technique that utilizes source test cases from source apps targeting the same functionality to extract a general test logic for that functionality. Then, we propose a concretization technique that utilizes the general test logic to guide an LLM in generating the corresponding GUI test case (including events and assertions) for the target app. We evaluate MACdroid on two widely-used datasets (including 31 apps, 34 functionalities, and 123 test cases). On the FrUITeR dataset, the test cases generated by MACdroid successfully test 64% of the target functionalities, improving the baselines by 191%.

In this paper, an advanced object detection neural network, named YOLO-v2, is implemented which achieves 98.2% and 84.5% average precision in training and testing, respectively. The proposed YOLO-v2 is used in combination with the classification neural network, which improves the identification accuracy for critical damage state of reinforced concrete structures by 7.5%. The improved classification procedures allow engineers to rapidly and more accurately quantify the damage states of the structure, and also localize the critical damage features. The identified damage state can then be integrated with the state-of-the-art performance evaluation framework to quantify the financial losses of critical reinforced concrete buildings.

We analyze the connection between abstract minions, which can be described as functors from the category of finite ordinals to sets, and concrete minions, which are sets $\\mathrm{Pol}(A, B)$ of polymorphisms $A^k \\to B$ between relational structures $A$ and $B$. The functorial structure arises because a function $α\\colon n \\to k$ transforms an $n$-ary polymorphism $f\\colon A^n \\to B$ to the polymorphism $(x_0, \\ldots, x_{k-1}) \\mapsto f(x_{α(0)}, \\ldots, x_{α(n-1)})$. This data is relevant to the constraint satisfaction problems over finite domain, because minion homomorphisms $\\mathrm{Pol}(A, B) \\to \\mathrm{Pol}(A', B')$ give rise to log-space reductions from the promise constraint satisfaction problem $\\mathrm{PCSP}(A', B')$ to $\\mathrm{PCSP}(A, B)$. Thus, they are valuable to understand the homomorphism order of polymorphism minions over finite-domain structures, especially since it is unknown whether the P vs. NP complexity dichotomy of constraint satisfaction problems extends to the more generalized promise setting.\n  Crucially, although implicitly used in some papers to solve nontrivial problems, the concept of an abstract minion has not been exposed on so far, even though much is known about functor categories. The aim of this thesis is to start closing this gap, and to apply well-known constructions from category theory to minions. Furthermore, we identify a condition under which an abstract minion can arise as a concrete one over a finite domain, and deduce that many constructions remain stable under some of these concreteness assumptions. We will conclude that some of the homomorphism orders in question are uncountable distributive bounded lattices, and moreover (bi-) Heyting algebras.

Linear Elastic (LE) analysis are performed in Abaqus (v-6.11) order to identify the optimized geometry of DTR dowels that would achieve (1) highest load transfer across adjacent slabs through shear action, and (2) lowest bearing stresses on the concrete. LE analyses are complemented by nonlinear FE analysis. The Riks method available in Abaqus/Standard, coupled with the Concrete Damaged Plasticity (CDP) model is used to simulate the degradation of concrete surrounding both DTR the traditional cylindrical dowels. Results obtained show that the use of DTR dowels can reduce bearing stresses at the face of the joint by as much 2.2 times as compared to traditional cylindrical dowels. While adequate load-transfer is a crucial part for the proper performance pavement structures, the load-transfer capacity of DTR dowels was more effective over cylindrical dowels by as far as 116%. In the inelastic range, even after significant concrete degradation and steel yielding, DTR dowels maintained a higher load-transfer capacity than traditional cylindrical dowels, and also presented lower amounts of differential deflections across concrete floors.

In this paper, a novel machine learning-based model is proposed to predict the backbone curve of reinforced concrete shear (structural) walls based on key wall design properties. Reported experimental responses of a detailed test database consisting of 384 reinforced concrete shear walls under cyclic loading were utilized to predict seven critical points to define the backbone curves, namely: shear at cracking point; shear and displacement at yielding point; and peak shear force and corresponding displacement; and ultimate displacement and corresponding shear. The predictive models were developed based on the Gaussian Process Regression method (GPR), which adopts a non-parametric Bayesian approach. The ability of the proposed GPR-based model to make accurate and robust estimations for the backbone curves was validated based on unseen data using a hundred random sampling procedure. The prediction accuracies (i.e., ratio of predicted/actual values) are close to 1.0, whereas the coefficient of determination (R2) values range between 0.90-0.97 for all backbone points. The proposed GPR-based backbone models are shown to reflect cyclic behavior more accurately than the traditional methods, therefore, they would serve the earthquake engineering community for better evaluation of the seismic performance of existing buildings.", "authors": "[\"Zeynep Tuna Deger\", \"Gulsen Taskin Kaya\"]", "venue": null, "year": null, "date": null, "relevance_score": null, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": null, "file_size": null, "source": "paperscraper_arxiv", "oa_status": "fulltext_pdf", "topic": null}

To evaluate the secondary seismic behavior of the joints in lightweight steel added stories after seismic damage repair, a low-cycle load test was conducted in this study. Following the initial damage, carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) was applied for reinforcement, along with epoxy resin for the repair of concrete cracks. The experimental analysis focused on the structural deformation, failure characteristics, and energy dissipation capacity in both the original and repaired joint states. On the basis of the experimental findings, finite element analysis was carried out to examine the influence of varying CFRP layer configurations on the seismic performance of the repaired joints. The results revealed a significant change in the damage pattern of the repaired specimen, shifting from secondary surface damage to significant concrete deterioration localized at the bottom of the column. The failure mechanism was characterized by the CFRP-induced tensile forces acting on the concrete at the column base, following considerable deformation at the beam's end. When compared to the original joint, the repaired joints exhibited markedly improved performance, with a 33% increase in horizontal ultimate strength and an 85% increase in energy dissipation capacity at failure. Additionally, the rotation angle between the beams and columns was effectively controlled. Joints repaired with two layers of CFRP demonstrated superior performance in contrast to those with a single layer. However, once the repaired joints met the required strength, further increasing the number of CFRP layers had a minimal influence on the mechanical properties of the joints.

Based on the exceptional electrical conductivity and mechanical properties of carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP), a novel structural system employing ICCP is proposed in this paper, in which CFRP strips are used as both concrete stirrups and as an auxiliary anode for cathodic protection. To further verify the dual functions of CFRP strips for this new system, the electrochemical and mechanical behaviors of the CFRP strip anode are investigated experimentally in this study through the anodic polarization test, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy test, uniaxial tensile test, and interfacial acidification test. The effects of concrete type and anode current density on the properties of CFRP strip anodes are identified. The results show that the CFRP strip anode possesses satisfactory electrical conductivity and relatively low output resistance, and the ultimate strength of the CFRP strip after polarization is reduced as the current density increases due to the gradual degradation of the CFRP anode. The mechanical properties of CFRP strips in Engineered Cementitious Cement (ECC) concrete and geopolymer concrete outperform those of ordinary concrete, and the degradation rate of CFRP strips subjected to anodic polarization in ECC concrete is lower than that of geopolymer concrete. The cathodic protection mechanism of CFRP strips as an anode is further revealed via numerical analysis. In addition, the prediction model of the service life is constructed for the proposed novel concrete structural system. The predicted service life of the system decreases as the reinforcement ratio increases, and it increases as the stirrup ratio increases.

In concrete applications, bacterial self-healing has been shown to seal cracks up to 0.8 mm wide and improve water tightness by 70-90%. Similarly, biofilm-mediated corrosion barriers can extend the durability of reinforced steel by significantly reducing chloride ingress, while bacterial biopolymers such as xanthan gum and curdlan enhance soil cohesion and water retention in eco-grouting and erosion control. The novelty of this review lies in its interdisciplinary scope, integrating microbiological mechanisms, materials science, and engineering practice to highlight how bacterial processes can transition from laboratory models to real-world applications. By combining quantitative evidence with critical assessment of scalability, biosafety, and regulatory challenges, this paper provides a comprehensive framework that positions construction biotechnology as a transformative pathway towards low-carbon, adaptive, and resilient infrastructure systems.", "authors": "[\"Olja\\u0160ovljanski\", \"AnaTomi\\u0107\", \"TianaMilovi\\u0107\", \"VesnaBulatovi\\u0107\", \"AleksandraRanitovi\\u0107\", \"DragoljubCvetkovi\\u0107\", \"Sini\\u0161aMarkov\"]", "venue": "Microorganisms", "year": 2025, "date": null, "relevance_score": null, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": false, "license": null, "file_size": null, "source": "paperscraper_pubmed", "oa_status": "closed", "topic": null}

The primary specimens for the pullout test are designed with a bond length equal to 20 times the bar diameter. To investigate the distribution of bond stress along the rebar in detail, a bond analysis was performed using the local bond stress-slip model as a function of the induced crack width that is developed based on the pullout test of the specimens with a bond length of four times the rebar diameter. The EAFP simulation showed a tendency for larger crack widths at the free end, likely due to filling the expansion agent from the load-end side. From the results of the pullout bond test, as the induced crack width increases, the maximum bond stress decreases. The results of the bond analysis, assuming the five patterns of crack width distributions along the longitudinal direction, showed that the bond stress-slip curve is little affected by the difference in the crack width distribution. Within a bonded length up to 20 times the rebar diameter, the differences in crack width variations had little effect on the distribution of the local bond stress.

Most studies isolate uniform corrosion or a single non-uniform corrosion pattern and ignore the effects of boundary restraint and structural configurations, leading to inaccurate predictions of cracking thresholds and crack propagation patterns. This study systematically investigates the influence mechanisms of constraint conditions and structural configurations on corrosion-induced cracking behavior using the phase-field model. The results indicate that the non-uniformity of steel corrosion is a critical factor governing cover cracking. As the corrosion non-uniformity coefficient increases, the critical corrosion level exhibits a monotonic decreasing trend-from 0.95% to 0.15% under strong constraints and from 0.52% to 0.15% under weak constraints. Concurrently, the crack morphology evolves from a single radial crack to a wedge-shaped crack oriented toward the peak corrosion side. The influence of constraint conditions is dualistic, while strong constraints enhance the failure threshold, their mitigating effect diminishes markedly under highly non-uniform corrosion. The critical corrosion threshold for eccentrically arranged corner reinforcement is significantly lower than that for centrally arranged reinforcement; the corrosion angle only induces slight crack deflection and minor threshold fluctuations; and the curved top section, due to its weaker equivalent constraint, exhibits inferior crack resistance compared to the linear top section. Three-dimensional analysis reveals a pronounced longitudinal discreteness effect, which not only substantially elevates the critical corrosion threshold but also leads to diverse spatial failure modes. This work links rust-expansion eigen-displacement to crack propagation within a unified phase-field framework, providing materials-level criteria for evaluating corrosion tolerance and guiding the design of cover materials and reinforcement layouts to enhance durability.", "authors": "[\"PengfeiZhang\", \"LingyeLeng\", \"WenqiangXu\", \"ShengQiang\", \"HuiWang\", \"ZiangZhao\"]", "venue": "Materials (Basel, Switzerland)", "year": 2025, "date": null, "relevance_score": null, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": false, "license": null, "file_size": null, "source": "paperscraper_pubmed", "oa_status": "closed", "topic": null}

Finite element (FE) simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics were performed with both constant and time-dependent chloride diffusion coefficients obtained from experimental data. Four concrete mixtures with varying water-to-binder (w/b) ratios and SCM contents were tested. Chloride diffusion coefficients, measured from samples exposed to a 165 g/L NaCl solution for 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, were incorporated into the simulations. The results showed that concretes with a higher w/b ratio (0.55) experienced greater chloride penetration, with diffusion coefficients ranging from 8.574 × 10⁻¹² m²/s (at 3 months) to 5.635 × 10⁻¹² m²/s (at 12 months), whereas concretes with a lower w/b ratio (0.45) exhibited superior resistance, with diffusion coefficients decreasing from 6.494 × 10⁻¹² m²/s (at 3 months) to 4.401 × 10⁻¹² m²/s (at 12 months). SCMs significantly reduced chloride penetration in both w/b ratios; SF-containing concrete achieved the lowest diffusion coefficient (1.563 × 10⁻¹² m²/s at 12 months), due to its ability to densify the concrete matrix. Time-dependent diffusion modelling improved SL prediction accuracy, reducing simulation errors to below 30%, compared to 48-75% for constant models. SL predictions further highlighted the durability benefits of SCMs: concrete with GGBFS demonstrated a potential SL of 62 years (variable diffusion model), compared to 10 years (constant model), while SF-enhanced concrete achieved even greater longevity, with SL extending up to 106 years using variable models.

This study evaluates three industrially feasible pretreatment methods-sieve-washing, water immersion, and resin impregnation - through a novel combination of semi-quantitative microstructural analysis and durability testing. Our findings demonstrate that resin treatment reduces carbonation depth by 38% compared to untreated RCA, primarily through pore structure modification. At the same time, water immersion enhances ITZ density by optimizing moisture release during hydration. However, resin-treated aggregates exhibited significantly lower compressive strength due to poor adhesion of the new paste. After 28 days, concrete with saturated recycled aggregate showed similar compressive (49.1 ± 0.7 MPa) and flexural strength (5.8 ± 0.3 MPa), but slightly higher carbonation depth than the concrete with only natural aggregate.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide, oxygen, and moisture from the atmosphere penetrate into the beam interior through these cracks, accelerating the carbonation of the concrete and the corrosion of the steel bars. The rust-induced expansion of steel bars further exacerbates the cracking of the beam. The interaction between environmental factors and beam cracks leads to a rapid decline in the durability of the beam. To address this issue, a multi-physics field coupling durability assessment method was proposed, considering concrete beam cracking, concrete carbonation, and steel bar corrosion. The interaction among these three factors is achieved through sequential coupling, using crack width, carbonation passivation time, and steel bar corrosion rate as interaction parameters. Using this method, the deterioration morphology and stiffness degradation laws of 8 m reinforced concrete beams under different load conditions, including those of heavy and light trains in heavy-haul railways, are compared and assessed. The analysis reveals that within a 100-year service cycle, the maximum relative stiffness reduction for beams on the heavy train line is 20.0%, whereas for the light train line, it is only 7.4%.

However, under impact loading conditions such as falling objects or debris, their brittle nature makes them prone to cracking and damage. To address this, Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) has been explored as an energy-absorbing material capable of reducing the severity of impact forces. Traditionally used as an insulating material, EPS possesses favorable mechanical properties-lightweight, high deformability, and cushioning capacity-that have led to its application in civil infrastructure as geofoam and lightweight fill. Despite its growing use, the potential of EPS as a protective surface layer for RC slabs under impact loading remains underexplored. This study investigates the effectiveness of a surface-mounted EPS layer in reducing the impact response of RC slabs. Six full-scale RC slab specimens were tested under vertical impact from a 90 kg steel ball dropped from a height of 1 m. Half of the specimens were cast as control slabs, while the other half included a 5 cm thick EPS layer atop the concrete. Accelerometers were used to capture dynamic responses, and a detailed finite element model was developed in ABAQUS, incorporating experimentally measured material properties and contact interaction at the EPS-concrete interface. The model accounted for separation and frictional behavior between the two materials. Experimental and numerical results showed that the EPS layer significantly reduced the maximum acceleration, displacement, and energy dissipation within the concrete slab compared to the control specimens. While control slabs absorbed more energy through cracking and damage, the EPS slabs exhibited reduced structural deterioration, indicating more efficient impact mitigation. These findings highlight the potential of EPS as a cost-effective solution to enhance the impact resistance of RC slabs. Future work will focus on parametric studies involving EPS thickness, EPS density, steel reinforcement ratio, intensity of impact load and concrete material properties to generalize the results for broader applications.", "authors": "[\"YosraEl-Maghraby\", \"JohnWael\", \"AyaAssem\", \"Ahmad EKhalil\"]", "venue": "Scientific reports", "year": 2025, "date": null, "relevance_score": null, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": false, "license": null, "file_size": null, "source": "paperscraper_pubmed", "oa_status": "closed", "topic": null}

Nevertheless, when subjected to combined saline and stray current conditions, R-UHPC remains vulnerable to severe corrosion degradation. This investigation examined the corrosion performance and tensile behavior evolution of R-UHPC containing 2.0 vol% copper-coated steel fiber content and HRB400 steel rebar with a reinforcement ratio of 3.1%. The accelerated corrosion process was induced through an impressed current method, followed by direct tensile tests at varying exposure periods. The findings revealed that the embedding of rebar in UHPC led to the formation of fiber-to-rebar (F-R) conductive pathways, generating radial cracks besides laminar cracks. The bonding between rebar and UHPC degraded as corrosion progressed, leading to the loss of characteristic multiple-cracking behavior of R-UHPC in tension. Meanwhile, R-UHPC load-bearing capacity, transitioning from gradual to accelerated deterioration phases with prolonged corrosion, aligns with steel fibers temporally. During the initial 4 days of corrosion, the specimens displayed surface-level corrosion features with negligible steel fiber loss, showing less than 4.0% reduction in ultimate bearing capacity. At 8 days of corrosion, the steel fiber decreased by 22.6%, accompanied by an 18.3% reduction in bearing capacity. By 16 days of corrosion, the steel fiber loss reached 41.5%, with a corresponding bearing capacity reduction of 29.1%.

This paper analyses and summarises the current application status of damage theories in the durability study of concrete structures in detail, and proposes the concept of deterioration function to consider the degree of structural damage. Then, the application of the Gurson meso-damage model in the durability study of underground structures is introduced and analysed in terms of theory, formulation and procedure. This paper develops a model for a typical underground lining structure to simulate its performance under in-situ stresses and environmental conditions. In the developed model, assumptions are introduced to account for the corrosion progression of the steel bars in the structure and damage mechanics theory is applied to determine the damage stresses in the lining structure.

Currently, only the effect of the active admixture on the compressive strength of concrete and cement mortars is considered when determining the k-value, but not the effect of the active admixture on durability. To account for the influence of durability factors on the determination of the k-value, the mathematical functions of the property, dependent on the water/cement ratio and the age of the cement mortar, were constructed using regression analysis. From the determined functions, it was then possible to use an optimisation problem to determine the k-value so the difference between the actual measurement and calculated depth of pressure water seepage or carbonation was as small as possible.

Directly optimizing the long-term user engagement is a non-trivial problem, as the learning target is usually not available for conventional supervised learning methods.

The complexity arises from the intricate interactions between scales and the interplay of diverse physical processes, which manifest in PDEs through coupled, nonlinear terms that govern the evolution of multiple physical fields across scales. Neural operators have shown potential in short-term prediction of such complex spatio-temporal dynamics; however, achieving stable high-fidelity predictions and providing robust uncertainty quantification over extended time horizons remains an open and unsolved area of research. These limitations often lead to stability degradation with rapid error accumulation, particularly in long-term forecasting of systems characterized by multi-scale behaviors involving dynamics of different orders. To address these challenges, we propose an autoregressive Spatio-temporal Fourier Transformer (StFT), in which each transformer block is designed to learn the system dynamics at a distinct scale through a dual-path architecture that integrates frequency-domain and spatio-temporal representations. By leveraging a structured hierarchy of \\ours blocks, the resulting model explicitly captures the underlying dynamics across both macro- and micro- spatial scales. Furthermore, a generative residual correction mechanism is introduced to learn a probabilistic refinement temporally while simultaneously quantifying prediction uncertainties, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of long-term probabilistic forecasting.

To speed up the process, corrosion tests with impressed currents have been developed in which the corrosion rate is controlled to be so high that cracking of the concrete cover occurs within a few days. Extrapolating the results of these accelerated tests to those of naturally occurring corrosion requires an understanding of the influence of long-term creep deformations of concrete on the corrosion-induced cracking process. In mathematical models in the literature, creep deformations are often ignored for accelerated but considered for natural corrosion rates in the form of an effective modulus. Here, three numerical models of increasing complexity are proposed with the aim to investigate the effect of creep on corrosion-induced cracking. The simplest approach is based on an uncracked axis-symmetric thick-walled cylinder combined with a plastic limit on the radial pressure-induced by the accumulation of rust. The model with intermediate complexity comprises a thick-walled cylinder model divided into an inner cracked and an outer uncracked layer. The most comprehensive model consists of a thick-walled cylinder discretised by a three-dimensional lattice approach. Basic creep is predicted in all three approaches by means of the B3 model developed by Bažant and co-workers. Time dependence of strength of concrete is modelled using fib Model Code expressions.

Safe RL methods are developed to handle this issue by constraining the expected safety violation costs as a training objective, but the occurring probability of an unsafe state is still high, which is unacceptable in autonomous driving tasks. Moreover, these methods are difficult to achieve a balance between the cost and return expectations, which leads to learning performance degradation for the algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on the long and short-term constraints (LSTC) for safe RL. The short-term constraint aims to enhance the short-term state safety that the vehicle explores, while the long-term constraint enhances the overall safety of the vehicle throughout the decision-making process, both of which are jointly used to enhance the vehicle safety in the training process. In addition, we develop a safe RL method with dual-constraint optimization based on the Lagrange multiplier to optimize the training process for end-to-end autonomous driving.

While several existing methods optimize attention computation, they still process the full set of hidden states at each layer, limiting overall efficiency. In this work, we propose SlimInfer, an innovative framework that aims to accelerate inference by directly pruning less critical prompt tokens during the forward pass. Our key insight is an information diffusion phenomenon: As information from critical tokens propagates through layers, it becomes distributed across the entire sequence. This diffusion process suggests that LLMs can maintain their semantic integrity when excessive tokens, even including these critical ones, are pruned in hidden states. Motivated by this, SlimInfer introduces a dynamic fine-grained pruning mechanism that accurately removes redundant tokens of hidden state at intermediate layers. This layer-wise pruning naturally enables an asynchronous KV cache manager that prefetches required token blocks without complex predictors, reducing both memory usage and I/O costs.

This paper presents a two-stage Coarse-to-Fine Index-shared Retrieval (CFIR) framework, designed for fast and effective large-scale long-text to image retrieval. The first stage, Entity-based Ranking (ER), adapts to long-text query ambiguity by employing a multiple-queries-to-multiple-targets paradigm, facilitating candidate filtering for the next stage. The second stage, Summary-based Re-ranking (SR), refines these rankings using summarized queries. We also propose a specialized Decoupling-BEiT-3 encoder, optimized for handling ambiguous user needs and both stages, which also enhances computational efficiency through vector-based similarity inference. Evaluation on the AToMiC dataset reveals that CFIR surpasses existing MLLMs by up to 11.06% in Recall@1000, while reducing training and retrieval times by 68.75% and 99.79%, respectively.

Oriented molecules are useful in many applications, such as molecular orbital tomography, femtosecond imaging of molecular structure, dynamics and chemical reaction control. In this work, we present a novel, previously unreported phenomenon appearing in thermal ensembles of non-linear polar molecules excited by a single THz pulse. We find that the induced orientation lasts long after the excitation pulse is over. In the case of symmetric-top molecules, the ensemble averaged orientation remains indefinitely constant after the pulse, whereas in the case of asymmetric-top molecules the orientation persists for a long time after the end of the pulse. We discuss the underlying mechanism, study its non-monotonous temperature dependence, and show that there exists an optimal temperature for the maximal residual orientation.

Long-lasting means that the time averaged orientation remains non-zero until destroyed by other physical effects, e.g. intermolecular collisions. The effect is caused by the combined action of the field-polarizability and field-hyperpolarizability interactions.

A computer-based technique is presented for reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in this study, incorporating optimization numerical approaches, techniques of optimality criteria and pushover analysis to seismic design automatically the pushover drift performance. The optimal design based on the performance of concrete beams, columns and shear walls in concrete moment frames is presented using the artificial bee colony optimization algorithm. The design is applied to three frames such as a 4-story, an 8-story and a 12-story. These structures are designed to minimize the overall weight while satisfying the levels of performance include Life Safety (L-S), Collapse Prevention (C-P), and Immediate Occupancy (I-O). To achieve this goal, three main steps are performed. In the first step, optimization codes are implemented in MATLAB software, and the OpenSees software is used for nonlinear static analysis of the structure. By solving the optimization problem, several top designs are obtained for each frame and shear wall. Pushover analysis is performed considering the constraints of relative displacement and plastic hinge rotation based on the nonlinear provisions of FEMA356 code to achieve each levels of performance. Following this, convergence, pushover, and drift history curves are plotted for each frame, and selecting the best design for each frame ultimately occurs.

Firstly, the Lie symmetry analysis of the equation is carried out in the first part. And the optimal system of the equation is obtained according to the symmetry, and the invariant solution and the reduced form of the target equation are solved according to the results. Secondly, we use different methods to solve the conservation law of the target equation. To begin with, we give the adjoint determination equation and adjoint symmetry of the 1+1 dimensional dispersive long-wave equation, and use the adjoint symmetry as the equation multiplier to find several conservation laws. Then we get a Lie bracket by using the relationship between the symmetry of the equation and the adjoint symmetry. Next its strict self-adjoint property is verified, and its conservation laws are solved by Ibragimov's method. Finally, the conservation laws of the target equation are solved by Noether's theorem. Thirdly we calculate some exact solutions of the target equation by three different methods. In the end of the paper, the Hamiltonian structure of the target equation, the generalized pre-symplectic that maps symmetries into adjoint-symmetries and some of its soliton solutions are calculated. In conclusion, we use the direct construction of conservation law method, Ibragimov's method and so on to solve some new conservation laws of 1+1 dimensional dispersive long-wave equation, use the relationship between symmetry and adjoint symmetry to construct the corresponding Lie brackets, and obtain some linear soliton solutions according to the conservation law of the equation.", "authors": "[\"Long Ju\", \"Faiza Afzal\", \"Yufeng Zhang\"]", "venue": null, "year": 2023, "date": null, "relevance_score": null, "status": "not_fetched", "local_path": null, "pdf_path": null, "content_path": null, "content_chars": null, "open_access": true, "license": null, "file_size": null, "source": "paperscraper_arxiv", "oa_status": "fulltext_pdf", "topic": null}

Recent works have achieved promising results by exploiting graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture network structure. However, they rarely analyze the realistic node-level bottlenecks that hinder UIL's performance. First, node degrees in a graph vary widely and are long-tailed. A significant fraction of tail nodes with small degrees are underrepresented due to limited structural information, degrading linkage performance seriously. The second bottleneck usually overlooked is super head nodes. It is commonly accepted that head nodes perform well. However, we find that some of them with super high degrees also have difficulty aligning counterparts, due to noise introduced by the randomness of following friends in real-world social graphs. In pursuit of learning ideal representations for these two groups of nodes, this paper proposes a degree-aware model named DegUIL to narrow the degree gap. To this end, our model complements missing neighborhoods for tail nodes and discards redundant structural information for super head nodes in embeddings respectively. Specifically, the neighboring bias is predicted and corrected locally by two modules, which are trained using the knowledge from structurally adequate head nodes. As a result, ideal neighborhoods are obtained for meaningful aggregation in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model.

We demonstrate that RAC's retrieval module, without prompting, learns a high level of accuracy on tail classes. This, in turn, frees the base encoder to focus on common classes, and improve its performance thereon.

However, the current vehicle color recognition research involves at most 13 types of colors and the recognition accuracy is low, which is difficult to meet practical applications. To this end, this paper has built a benchmark dataset (Vehicle Color-24) that includes 24 types of vehicle colors, including 10091 vehicle pictures taken from 100 hours of urban road surveillance videos.

In addition, the average accuracy rate of the model when recognizing 8 types of colors is 97.25%, and the detection accuracy of algorithms in similar databases is improved.

Successive generations, including GPT-o series, DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K1.5, Grok 4, and GLM-4.5, have relied on large-scale RL training to enhance reasoning and coding capabilities. To meet the community's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed. However, RL training remains computationally expensive, with rollout generation accounting for more than 90% of total runtime. In addition, its efficiency is often constrained by the long-tail distribution of rollout response lengths, where a few lengthy responses stall entire batches, leaving GPUs idle and underutilized. As model and rollout sizes continue to grow, this bottleneck increasingly limits scalability. To address this challenge, we propose Active Partial Rollouts in Reinforcement Learning (APRIL), which mitigates long-tail inefficiency. In the rollout phase, APRIL over-provisions rollout requests, terminates once the target number of responses is reached, and recycles incomplete responses for continuation in future steps. This strategy ensures that no rollouts are discarded while substantially reducing GPU idle time. Experiments show that APRIL improves rollout throughput by 22.5% on average (at most 44%) across commonly used RL algorithms (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO), accelerates convergence, and achieves 2.1% on average(at most 8%) higher final accuracy across tasks. Moreover, APRIL is both framework and hardware agnostic, already integrated into the slime RL framework, and deployable on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs alike. Taken together, this work unifies system-level and algorithmic considerations in proposing APRIL, with the aim of advancing RL training efficiency and inspiring further optimizations in RL systems.
